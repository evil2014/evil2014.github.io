Figure shows a network that consists of two routers and five network addresses between the two.  On the first router a default route to the second router is configured.  This is because the next router is the next hop router for all network traffic coming from the first router, including the Internet.  A default route is the most efficient configuration for the router.  The second router only needs to reach two networks that are directly connected to the first router.  To most efficiently reach those two networks, two static routes are configured on the second router that point to the first router.
