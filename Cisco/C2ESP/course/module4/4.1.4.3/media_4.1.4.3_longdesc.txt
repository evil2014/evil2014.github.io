Figure one shows an example using filtering commands with the Cisco I.O.S.  In the example the command show running dash config pipe section line v.t.y. is entered and the result is the section of the running configuration that is for the v.t.y. lines. Figure two shows an example of using a filtering command, and it is show i.p. interface brief pipe include up.  The output lists three interfaces that are up, meaning they are active. Figure three shows an example of using a filtering command, and it is show i.p. interface brief pipe exclude unassigned.  The output lists three interfaces that are up, meaning they are active.  Noticeably missing is the fourth interface on the router that doesnâ€™t currently have an i.p. address assigned, hence this interface address is unassigned and omitted from the output. Figure four shows an example of using a filtering command, and it is show i.p. route pipe begin Gateway.  The output lists the contents of the show i.p. route command beginning with the keyword gateway and continuing through the end of the output. Figure five is an interactive media element that allows the learner to practice using filtering commands.
