Figure one is a table of console connection requirements for Cisco routers.  The column headings are as follows: port on computer, Cable Required, Port on I.S.R., and Terminal Emulation.  For example using a serial port on a computer requires an R.J. dash 45 to D.B. dash 9 console cable, and connects to the R.J. dash 45 console port on the router.  Either terminal emulation program Tera Term or Putty can be used. Figure two is the same table but with pictures of the ports and cables.
