Figure one depicts process switching, in which an incoming packet is sent to the control plane and the destination address is read and sent to the appropriate interface.  In this method, each packet must be processed by the C.P.U. Figure two depicts fast switching, in which a fast forward cache is used to make the routing process more efficient when it is determined that a packet can be routed based on the information in the cache.  If the cache doesnâ€™t have the needed information then the packet is sent to the control plane. Figure three depicts the Cisco Express Forwarding process where the router builds a Forwarding Information Base and an adjacency table, and the router uses these to route the packets.
