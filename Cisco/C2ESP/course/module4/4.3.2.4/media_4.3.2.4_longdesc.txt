Figure one shows the configuration steps for the directly connected interfaces of a router with I.P.v.6 addresses.  The commands begin in global configuration mode.  The first command moves to the interface, the command is interface gigabit Ethernet zero slash zero.  The next command puts a description in the configuration file for the interface, and the command is description Link to LAN 1.  The next command assigns the i.p. address, and is i.p. v 6 address 2001 colon d b 8 colon a c a d colon one colon colon 1 slash 64.  The interface must now be turned on with the no shutdown command.  The interface is changed to the status of up.  The process is repeated for the next two interfaces on the router. Figure two shows the output of the show i.p.v.6. route command.  This will display the I.P. version 6 routing table and is very similar to the I.P. v 4 routing table. Figure three shows the output of the route specific command show i.p. v 6 route 2001 colon d b 8 colon a c a d colon 1 colon colon slash 64.  This will display only the route table entry for the specified network.  In the figure this is a connected route. Figure four shows the I.P. version 6 ping command.  The syntax is ping 2001 colon d b 8 colon a c a d colon 3 colon colon 2.  In the figure, five 100-byte echo requests were sent and 5 were received.  Figure five shows the I.P. version 6 ping command.  The syntax is ping 2001 colon d b 8 colon a c a d colon 4 colon colon 1.  In the figure five 100-byte echo requests were sent and zero were received because there is no route for the specified network.
