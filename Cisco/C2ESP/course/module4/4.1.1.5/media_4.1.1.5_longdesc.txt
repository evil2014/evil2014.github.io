Figure shows two LANs. Each LAN has a router. The LANs are connected to each other by a WAN link.  Each router has a switch connected to an Ethernet port, and each switch has multiple local devices connected to it.  An animation shows a packet being sent from a computer on one LAN to a computer on the other LAN.  The packet travels first to the switch, and then to the router.  When the router receives the packet it examines the packet and locates the destination I.P. address. Then the router looks at its own routing table to determine what path to use in order to deliver the packet.  The router transfers the packet to the serial port and sends it to the other router.  This router receives the packet on the serial interface and this router also goes through the I.P. examination step and the route table lookup step.  It transfers the packet to its Ethernet interface, and then it is sent to the switch, which delivers the packet to the destination computer.
