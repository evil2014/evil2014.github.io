Figure is an animation of a router receiving a data packet.  The figure shows that the router will accept the packet because the destination MAC address is that of the router.  The router reads the destination I.P. address and looks to its routing table to determine where to forward the packet.  The router determines that the packet needs to be sent to an Ethernet interface on the next router.  The router will encapsulate the data, use the next hop interface as the destination MAC address, and use its own MAC address as the source address.  The source and destination I.P. addresses are not changed.
