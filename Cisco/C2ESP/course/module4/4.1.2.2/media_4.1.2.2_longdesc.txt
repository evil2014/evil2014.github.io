Figure shows a switch with two computers and an F.T.P. server connected to it.  There is a link from the switch to a router. The router links to another router, which then links to a third router.  The default gateway for the two computers and the server is the router port that is connected to the switch.   The third router has a switch connected to it and a web server is connected to that switch.  The figure shows a P.D.U. that is formed when one of the computers needs to communicate with the web server.  The P.D.U. consists of the destination MAC address, which will be the MAC address of the default gateway since the web server is not on the local network and the packet must be sent to the router.  The source MAC will be that of the computer sending the request, and the source I.P. address will be from the sending computer.  The destination I.P. address will be that of the web server.
