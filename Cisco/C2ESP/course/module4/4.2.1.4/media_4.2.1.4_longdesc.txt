Figure is an animation of a router receiving a data packet.  The figure shows that the router will accept the packet because the destination MAC address is that of the router.  The router reads the destination I.P. address and looks to its routing table to determine where to forward the packet.  The router determines that the packet needs to be sent out a serial interface, which does not have a MAC address.  The router will encapsulate the data using a broadcast address for the layer two information.  The source and destination I.P. addresses are not changed.
