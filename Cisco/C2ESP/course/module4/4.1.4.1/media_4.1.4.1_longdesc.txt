Figure one shows the output of the show i.p. interfaces brief command run on a router.  In the output are two gigabit interfaces, two serial interfaces, the i.p. address, and the current operational status of each. Figure two shows the output of the show i.p. route command run on a router.  This router has three configured interfaces, so there are three connected routes identified in the first column by the letter C and three local routes identified in the first column with the letter L. Figure three displays the output of the show running-config interface gigabit Ethernet zero slash zero command.  This output lists more detailed information regarding the specified interface including the subnet mask. Figure four is an interactive activity that allows the learner run the show interfaces gigabit ethernet zero slash zero command and observe the output. Figure five is an interactive activity that allows the learner run the show i.p. interface gigabit ethernet zero slash zero command and observe the output.
