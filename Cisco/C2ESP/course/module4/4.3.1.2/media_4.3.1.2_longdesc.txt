Figure one shows a network consisting of two routers connected through a serial WAN link.  Each router has a switch on its two gigabit Ethernet ports.  Each of the four switches has a computer connected to it.  This network has five total networks, and therefore five network addresses.  The figure shows the output of the show i.p. route command being run on one of the routers.  The output lists the connected routes, the routers learned through a routing protocol, and the active interface i.p. addresses.
