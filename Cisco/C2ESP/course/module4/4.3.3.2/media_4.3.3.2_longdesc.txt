Figure one shows the configuration of an I.P. v 4 default static route on a router.  The command is i.p. route zero dot zero dot zero dot zero dot zero dot zero dot zero dot zero dot serial 0 slash 0 slash 0.  This is configuring the interface as the exit interface for the route.  The figure then shows the output of the show i.p. route pipe begin Gateway command.  This displays the entire routing table and it includes the static default route. Figure two shows the configuration of two static routes on the second router to reach the two LANs on the first router.  The first static route command is i.p. route 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot 0 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 0 s 0 slash 0 slash 0.  The second static route command is i.p. route 192 dot 168 dot 11 dot 0 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 0 209 dot 165 dot 200 dot 225.  The figure then shows the output from the show i.p. route pipe begin gateway command, which displays the entire routing table and it includes the static default route. Figure three is an interactive media element that allows the learner to configure a default static route on a router using the next hop i.p. address. Figure four is an interactive media element that allows the learner to configure a static route on a router using the next hop i.p. address.
