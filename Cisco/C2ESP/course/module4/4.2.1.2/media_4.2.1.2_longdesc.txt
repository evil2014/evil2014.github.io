Figure is an animation of a computer sending a data packet through three routers to another computer.  The figure shows that the sending computer recognizes that the destination computer is on a different network and therefore it has to send the packet to the default gateway.  The computer looks at its ARP cache to determine the MAC address of the default gateway and encapsulates the data into a packet using the MAC address of the gateway.
