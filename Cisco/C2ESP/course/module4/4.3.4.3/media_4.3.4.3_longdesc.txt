Figure shows a network of two routers connected through a WAN link, and each router has two active networks on the gigabit Ethernet ports.  The routers are running E.I.G.R.P. and the output from the show i.p. route pipe begin Gateway command is shown.  The routing table for the router lists the three connected routes, the three local interface i.p. address, two routes learned through E.I.G.R.P., and the one external route forwarded by E.I.G.R.P. that is the candidate default route.
