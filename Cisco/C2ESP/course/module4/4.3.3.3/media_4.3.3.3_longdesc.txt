Figure one shows the command sequence for entering a static default route for i.p. v 6.  The command is i.p.v.6. route colon colon slash zero s zero slash zero slash zero.  Figure two shows the output for the show i.p.v.6. route command.  The static route is displayed as colon colon slash zero. Figure three shows the configuration of two static routes from the second router to reach the two LANs on the first router. The first command is i.p.v.6. route 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon A C A D colon 2 colon colon slash 64 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon A C A D colon 3 colon colon 1.
