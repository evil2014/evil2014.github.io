Figure one shows the commands used to configure a description on an interface.  The commands begin from global configuration mode.  The first command moves to interface configuration mode and it is interface gigabit ethernet zero slash zero.  The next command configures the description and it is description Link to LAN 1.  The text after the word description becomes the description.  The next command in the figure assigns an I.P. address on the interface and it is i.p. address 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot 1 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 0.  The interface is turned on with the command no shutdown. Figure two configures a description and an i.p. address on the gigabit Ethernet zero slash one port.  The commands begin in global configuration mode.  The first command moves to interface configuration mode and it is interface gigabit ethernet zero slash one.  The next command configures the description and it is description Link to LAN 2.  The next command in the figure assigns an I.P. address on the interface and it is i.p. address 192 dot 168 dot 11 dot 1 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 0.  The interface is turned on with the command no shutdown. Figure three configures a serial interface and begins in global configuration mode.  The first command moves to interface configuration mode and it is interface serial zero slash zero slash zero.  The next command configures the description and it is description Link to R2.  The next command in the figure assigns an I.P. address on the interface and it is i.p. address 209 dot 165 dot 200 dot 225 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 252.  The next command configures a clock rate on the serial interface, and the command is clock rate 128,000.  The interface is turned on with the command no shutdown. Figure four is an interactive activity that allows the learner to configure the I.P. address, add a description, and activate an interface on a router.
