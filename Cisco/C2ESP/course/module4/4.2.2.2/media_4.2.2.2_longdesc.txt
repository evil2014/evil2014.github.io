Figure is an animation showing the difference between hop count and bandwidth as a routing metric.  The figure shows a computer sending a data packet to a destination computer and there are three routers that are forming a full mesh, which gives two potential paths for the data.  One route is using a 56 K.b.p.s. line and utilizes one router.  The other path has two routers, and each link is a T-1 link of 1.544 mega b.p.s.  When using hop count as the metric, the packet will travel the first path through one router.  When using bandwidth as the metric, the packet will follow the two T-1 links because the two T-1 links is a faster path than the one 56 k.b.p.s. link.
