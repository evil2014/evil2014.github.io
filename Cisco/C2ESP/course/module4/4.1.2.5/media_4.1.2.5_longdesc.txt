Figure shows a close-up view of the L.E.D.s on the Cisco 1941 series router.  Under the figure is a description explaining the purpose of each L.E.D.  For example, there are two L.E.D.s for the gigabit Ethernet ports. One is labeled with the letter S and the other is labeled with the letter L.  The L stands for link and will be lit green when the link is active.  If the port is inactive, the L.E.D. will be off.  The S stands for speed. One blink and a pause indicates the port is operating at ten megabits per second.  Two blinks followed by a pause indicates the port is operating at one hundred megabits per second. Three blinks followed by a pause indicates the port is operating at one thousand megabits per second.
