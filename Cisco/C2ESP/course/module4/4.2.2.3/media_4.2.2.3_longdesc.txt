Figure is an animation of equal cost load balancing done by routers.  The network shown has four routers connected in a square pattern with each router at a corner and a single link on each of the four sides.  A computer connected to the router at the top left corner sends data to a computer connected at the bottom right corner.  Being a square gives two paths for the data, and with equal load balancing, about half of the data will be sent across each of the two paths.
