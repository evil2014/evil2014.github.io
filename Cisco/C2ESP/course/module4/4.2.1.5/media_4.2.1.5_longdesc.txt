Figure is an animation of a router receiving a data packet.  The figure shows that the router will accept the packet because the layer two destination address is a broadcast.  The router reads the destination I.P. address and looks to its routing table to determine where to forward the packet.  The router determines that the packet needs to be sent out a local interface to a directly connected network.  The router looks at its ARP cache and determines the MAC address used by the destination I.P. address and it uses its own interface as the source MAC address.  The source and destination I.P. addresses are not changed.
