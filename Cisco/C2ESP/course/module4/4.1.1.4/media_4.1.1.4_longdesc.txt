Figure one shows two LANs. Each LAN has a router. The LANs are connected to each other by a WAN link. Each router has a switch connected to an Ethernet port, and each switch has multiple local devices connected to it.  An animation shows a packet being sent from a computer on one LAN to a computer on the other LAN.  The packet travels to the switch and then to the router, which transfers the packet to the serial port and sends it to the other router.  This router receives the packet on the serial interface and transfers it to its Ethernet interface.  The packet is then sent to the switch, which sends it to the destination device. Figure two shows three LANs that are all interconnected through WAN connections.
