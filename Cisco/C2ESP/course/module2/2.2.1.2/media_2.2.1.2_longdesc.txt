Figure one shows the commands used to configure a switch for remote management using s.s.h.  The figure begins in privilege exec mode.  The first command is, configure terminal.  The next command is, i.p. domain hyphen name cisco dot com, where cisco dot com is an example domain name.  The next command is, crypto key generate r.s.a.  The switch will ask for the size of the modulus, with a default value of 512.  In the figure, 1,024 is being used.  The next command is, username admin password c.c.n.a., where both admin and c.c.n.a. are examples. This command will create a username and a password.  The next step is to configure the v.t.y. lines to accept s.s.h. connections only.  The command is, line v.t.y. 0 15.  The next command is, transport input s.s.h.  The last command is, login local. Figure two is an interactive activity that allows the learner to configure s.s.h. on a switch.
