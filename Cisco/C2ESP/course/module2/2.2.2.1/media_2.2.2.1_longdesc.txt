Figure one shows a switch with three computers connected to it, host A, host B, and host C.  The figure shows a packet being sent from host A to host B, but the switch doesnâ€™t have an entry in the MAC table for host B, so the switch will flood the frame. Figure two shows host B responding to the flood. As host B sends a reply to host A, the switch adds host b to the MAC address table.  At the same time, host C drops the packet because it is not host B. Figure three shows host A spending another packet to host B. Now that the switch has a MAC address entry for host B the packet is send directly to host B. Figure four shows host C sending data packets with bogus source and destination MAC addresses in an attempt to overwhelm and crash the switch. Figure five shows a full MAC address table on a switch causing every packet to now be broadcasted to every port.  The switch has been overwhelmed and is now acting as a hub.
