Figure one shows a table listing the basic configuration commands for switch interfaces.  The C.L.I. begins in privilege exec mode and the first command is, configure terminal.  This will move to global configuration mode.  The next command is, interface fast Ethernet zero slash one, and the switch prompt becomes config hyphen i.f. inside the parentheses.  This moves to the configuration mode for the specified interface.  The next command is, duplex full. This command will set the duplex option to full.  The next command is, speed 100. This command will set the speed on the interface to 100 megabits per second.  The running configuration is copied to the startup configuration file with the command, copy running hyphen config startup hyphen config.
