Figure shows two sets of switches. One set is labeled Full and Half Duplex Communication. This set is connected with an Ethernet cable and depicts the ability to send and receive data simultaneously. The second set of switches is labeled Half-Duplex Communication. This set depicts the ability to send or receive data.  Switches use the MAC address to identify connected hosts, they record unique host addresses to a MAC address table, and they send and receive data traffic using unicasts, multicasts, and broadcasts.
