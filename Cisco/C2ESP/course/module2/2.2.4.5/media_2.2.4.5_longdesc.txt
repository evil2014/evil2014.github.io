Figure one summarizes the default port security configuration on a Cisco Catalyst switch.  Port security is disabled, when port security is set the maximum number of secure MAC addresses is set to one, the violation mode is shut down, and the sticky MAC address leaning is disabled. Figure two shows the C.L.I. commands needed to configure port security on a switch port interface.  The first command is, interface fast Ethernet zero slash 18. This command moves from global configuration mode to a specific interface.  The next command is, switchport mode access, which makes the port strictly an access port for an end device.  The last command is, switchport port hyphen security.  Figure three continues the previous example and adds the command, switchport port hyphen security maximum 50.  The last command is, switchport port hyphen security mac hyphen address sticky.
