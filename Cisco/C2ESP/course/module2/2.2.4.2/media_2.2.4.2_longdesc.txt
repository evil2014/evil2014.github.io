Figure one shows a switch with a d.h.c.p. server connected to a port that is configured as a trusted port.  The switch is connected to another switch that has a d.h.c.p. client computer on an untrusted port and an attacker rouge d.h.c.p. computer on an untrusted port.  The rogue computer cannot act as a server since the port is an untrusted port. Figure two shows the commands required to configure d.h.c.p. snooping on a switchport.  The figure begins in global configuration and the first step is to activate d.h.c.p. snooping with the command, i.p. d.h.c.p. snooping.  The next command is, i.p. d.h.c.p. snooping v. lan 10 comma 20.  This command enables d.h.c.p. snooping for v. lans 10 and 20 on the switch.  The next step is to configure all trusted ports at the interface configuration level.  The next command in this example is, interface fast Ethernet zero slash one.  In interface configuration mode the command is, i.p. d.h.c.p. snooping trust.  The example moves to another interface with the command, interface fast Ethernet zero slash 2.  The next command is, i.p. d.h.c.p. snooping limit rate 5.
