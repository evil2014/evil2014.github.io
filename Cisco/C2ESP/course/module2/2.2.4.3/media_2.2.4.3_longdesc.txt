Figure one shows an Ethernet port with a security shield next to it.  This represents the concept of securing switch ports.  The figure lists two points regarding security on switch ports.  The first is to specify a single MAC address or a group of valid MAC addresses allowed on a port.  The second is to specify that a port should automatically shut down if unauthorized MAC addresses are detected. Figure two lists characteristics of sticky secure switch ports.
