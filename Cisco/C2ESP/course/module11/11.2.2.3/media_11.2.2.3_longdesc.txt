Figure one shows router two with an inside network on the left and an outside network on the right. The inside network contains router one and two computers. The outside network contains a server.  There are packets traveling from both computers to the server with their corresponding inside and outside addresses displayed. The nat pool in use is listed below the image. Figure two shows the same topology with the packets traveling back to the computers from the server.
