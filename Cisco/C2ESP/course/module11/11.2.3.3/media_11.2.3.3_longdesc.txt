Figure one shows a diagram with source and destination addresses and ports for communication between the devices in the inside and outside networks.  The source port numbers are the same on the inside network, but they are not the same on the outside.  The nat table is listed below the image. Figure two shows the same diagram. However, this time it contains the return information.  The outside source ports are different even though the inside destination ports are the same.
