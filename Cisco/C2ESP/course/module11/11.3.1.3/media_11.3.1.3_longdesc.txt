Figure one shows router 2 with an inside network on the left and an outside network on the right. The inside network contains 2 computers and router one. The outside network contains two servers.  Router two is using pat.  A ping sent from p. c. 1. to server one fails. The output from the "show i. p. nat translations" command reveals no translations. Figure two shows the output from the "show i. p. nat statistics" command. The output reveals that the inside and outside interfaces are backwards.  The syntax for correcting this problem is listed below. Figure three shows the output from the "show access dash lists" command.  The syntax for removing the list and re-creating it is also listed. Figure four shows the output from the "show i. p. nat statistics" command and the "show i. p. nat translations" command.
