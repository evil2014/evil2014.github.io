Figure shows two routers labeled R-1 and R-2 connected through a serial WAN link.  The figure is an animation that begins with R-1 creating a message that contains network routing information and sends that update to the other router.  The receiving router uses this update to build or modify its routing table.  The receiving router will send an update when it detects a change in its networks.
