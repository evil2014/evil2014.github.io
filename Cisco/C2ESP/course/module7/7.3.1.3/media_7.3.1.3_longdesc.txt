Figure one shows the output from the command show i.p. protocols.  This router is running RIP version 1 and the output displays the values listed in the reading.  Figure two shows the output from the command show i.p. route pipe begin Gateway.  This lists the routing table showing two connected routes, two interface i.p. addresses, and three network routes learned via the RIP protocol.  These three networks are listed with a capital R in the table meaning that they were learned through RIP updates. Figure three is an interactive media element that allows the learner to use the show i.p. protocols command and the show i.p. route command to view the current routing protocol configuration and the routing table for a router.
