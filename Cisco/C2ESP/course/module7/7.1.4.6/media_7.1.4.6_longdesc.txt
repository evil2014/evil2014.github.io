Figure one shows the same network layout as the previous page.  In this figure, R-1 is running RIP version 2. Therefore, after every 30 second time period it sends a routing update consisting of the network address 172 dot 16 dot 1 dot 0 and now includes the subnet mask of 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 0.  Figure two shows R-2 receiving the update and adding the network advertised by R-1 to its routing table. Since it is a class B network with a non-default subnet mask it will list the class address as a parent route and then list all child routes. The address that is added is 172 dot 16 dot 1 dot 0.  Figure three shows R-3 running RIP version 2. Therefore, after every 30 second time period it sends a routing update consisting of the network address 172 dot 16 dot 2 dot 0 and now includes the subnet mask of 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 0. Figure four shows R2 receiving the update and adding the network advertised by R-3 to its routing table as another child route.  Figure five shows the result of a ping and a trace route being sent from R-2 to the address 172 dot 16 dot 1 dot 1. This time the results are perfect because the router now knows exactly where the specified host resides and there is only one route to reach it.
