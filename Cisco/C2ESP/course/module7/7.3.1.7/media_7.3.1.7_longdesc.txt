Figure one shows three routers connected linearly through WAN links.  R1 is connected to R2 through a serial WAN link, and it has a LAN on its gigabit-Ethernet interface.  R2 is connected to both R1 and R3 through serial WAN links, and has a LAN on its gigabit-Ethernet interface.  R3 is only connected to R2 through a serial WAN link, and has a LAN on its gigabit-Ethernet interface.  Router R-1 has a WAN link to the Internet cloud configured.  Figure two configures a static route on a router with the command i.p. route zero dot zero dot zero dot zero dot zero dot zero dot zero dot zero dot serial zero slash zero slash one 209 dot 165 dot 200 dot 226.  The router is then configured to run rip with the router rip command.  The default route is configured to propagate its default route with the command, default hyphen information originate.  This is verified with the command, show i.p. route pipe begin Gateway and it shows a gateway of last resort listed along with the default route listed.  The default route is labeled with a capital S with an asterisk next to it to indicate that it is a candidate default route. Figure three is an interactive media element that allows the learner to verify that the default route has been propagated to routers R-2 and R-3.
