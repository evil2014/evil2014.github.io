Figure shows a topology of three routers configured in a triangle layout. Each router is connected to the other two routers giving a full mesh topology.  Each router has two active serial WAN links with I.P.v.6. addresses and each router has a LAN on a gigabit Ethernet interface with an I.P.v.6. address.  The routing protocol used is E.I.G.R.P. for I.P.V.6.
