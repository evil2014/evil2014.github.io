Figure shows three routers connected linearly through WAN links.  Router R-1 is connected to router R-2 through a serial WAN link, and it has a LAN on an Ethernet interface.  R-2 is connected to both R-1 and R-3 through serial WAN links, and therefore has two networks.  R-3 is only connected to R-2 through a serial WAN link, and it has a LAN on an Ethernet interface.  The animation shows the routing table being built as each router adds its own connected networks into the routing table.
