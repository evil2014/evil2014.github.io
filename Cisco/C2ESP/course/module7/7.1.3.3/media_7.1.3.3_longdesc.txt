Figure is an animation that is a continuation of the previous page.  Each router adds their connected networks into an update packet and sends out the packets on each of the active interfaces.  As routers receive and read the packets from the other directly connected routers they will add the newly discovered networks into their own routing tables. They will also add the hop count as the metric for reaching that specific network.
