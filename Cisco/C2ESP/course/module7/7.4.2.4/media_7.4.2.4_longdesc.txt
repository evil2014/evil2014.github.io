Figure one shows 4 routers in a diamond pattern. Each router is directly connected to its two neighboring routers.  There is one router in the middle, and it is connected to two of the other routers.  The figure has link costs on each link between routers.  The figure focuses on router R-1, which has three active serial WAN links and a local network on a Fast Ethernet interface.  Figure is showing Router R-1 building a link state packet that it will send out an interface to a neighbor.
