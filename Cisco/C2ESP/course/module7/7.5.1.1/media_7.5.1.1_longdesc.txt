Figure shows three routers connected linearly through WAN links.  R-1 is connected to R-2 through a serial WAN link, and it has a LAN on an Ethernet interface.  R-2 is connected to both R-1 and R-3 through serial WAN links, and has a LAN on an Ethernet interface.  R-3 is only connected to R-2 through a serial WAN link, and has two LANs on Ethernet interfaces.  R-1 has a serial WAN link to the Internet, and router R-3 has a serial WAN link to another cloud network. Figure two shows the output from the command, show i.p. route pipe begin Gateway.  This shows the routing table for router R-1, which has three directly connected routes with three interface I.P. addresses, five routes learned through RIP, one candidate default route, and one gateway of last resort configured.
