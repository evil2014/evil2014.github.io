Figure one shows the command line commands to enable RIP version 1 routing for a specified network on a router.  The figure begins in global configuration mode.  The first command is router rip.  The next command uses the keyword network followed by the network address.  In the figure, two networks are configured on the router and the first command is network 192 dot 168 dot 1 dot 0.  The second command is 192 dot 168 dot 2 dot 0.  Note that when using RIP version 1, a subnet mask is not listed in the commands. Figure two is an interactive media element that allows the learner to enter the commands necessary to configure RIP and advertise appropriate networks on a router.
