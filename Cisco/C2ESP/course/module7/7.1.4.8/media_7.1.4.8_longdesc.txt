Figure shows three routers that are connected in a triangle layout. Each router is connected to the other two routers.  A computer connected to Router R-1 is sending a data packet to a computer connected to router R-2.  There are two possible paths for the data to follow.  One route is using a 56 k.b.p.s. line and consists of one router hop.  The other path consists of two router hops and each link is a T-1 link at 1.544 mega b.p.s.  The figure is an animation that shows the path RIP would follow and the path O.S.P.F. would follow.  When using hop count as the metric, as in RIP, the packet will travel the first path, through one router.  When using bandwidth as the metric, as is O.S.P.F., the packet will follow the two T-1 links because the two T-1 links is a faster path than the one 56 k.b.p.s. link.
