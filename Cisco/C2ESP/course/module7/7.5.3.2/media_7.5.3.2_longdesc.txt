Figure shows the process for checking for the longest match in the routing table.   The destination address for the packet is 172 dot 16 dot 0 dot 10 and the first step is to list the address in binary, which is one zero one zero one one zero zero dot zero zero zero one zero zero zero zero dot zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero dot zero zero zero zero one zero one zero.  There are three routes that can potentially be used to reach the destination, so the router has to look at each route and compare the binary values from left to right. The one that matches the most bits within the subnet mask will be the route chosen.  The three choices are a slash 12, a slash 18, and a slash 26.  The destination packet matches the most number of bits with the slash 26, so this will be the route selected.
