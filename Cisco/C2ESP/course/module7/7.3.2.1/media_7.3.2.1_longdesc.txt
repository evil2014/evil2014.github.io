Figure one shows three routers connected linearly through WAN links.  R1 is connected to R2 through a serial WAN link, and it has a LAN on its gigabit-Ethernet interface.  R2 is connected to both R1 and R3 through serial WAN links, and also has a LAN on its gigabit-Ethernet interface.  R3 is only connected to R2 through a serial WAN link, and a LAN on its gigabit-Ethernet interface.  All network addresses are i.p. version 6 addresses.  Figure shows the commands used to configure RIP N.G. routing on the interface.  The commands begin in global configuration mode and the first command is i.p. v 6 unicast hyphen routing.  The next step is to move to the specified interface, and the command here is interface gigabit ethernet zero slash zero.  The next command will enable i.p. v 6 routing, and it is i.p. v 6 rip hyphen A S enable.  The interface commands are repeated for the serial zero slash zero slash zero interface. Figure two is an interactive media element that allows the learner to configure RIP N.G. on a router.
