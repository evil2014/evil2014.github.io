Figure one shows the output of the show i.p. protocols command and is highlighting the line that says automatic network summarization is in effect. Figure two shows how to disable route summarization on a router running RIP. The command line begins in global configuration mode and the first command enables RIP, which is router rip.  The next command is no auto hyphen summary.  This command is verified with the command show i.p. protocols pipe section Automatic, and the output states that automatic network summarization is not in effect. Figure three is an interactive media element that allows the learner to configure RIP routing and disable automatic summarization on a router.
