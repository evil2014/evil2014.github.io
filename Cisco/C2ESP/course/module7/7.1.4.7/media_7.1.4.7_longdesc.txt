Figure is a table comparing routing protocols.  For example RIP is considered a slow converging protocol used on small networks and is easy to implement.  Version 1 of RIP does not use V.L.S.M., however, version 2 does use V.L.S.M.  E.I.G.R.P., O.S.P.F., and I.S.I.S. converge fast, are used on large networks, use V.L.S.M., and are more complex to implement and maintain.
