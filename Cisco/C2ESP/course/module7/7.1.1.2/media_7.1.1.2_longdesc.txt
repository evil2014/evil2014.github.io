Figure highlights the data structures, routing protocol messages, and routing algorithm used by E.I.G.R.P.  For the data structures, E.I.G.R.P. creates and maintains a topology table and a neighbor table.  The messages in E.I.G.R.P. include hello, update, query, reply, and acknowledgment packets.  E.I.G.R.P. uses the diffusing update algorithm, better known as DUAL.
