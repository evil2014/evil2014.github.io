Figure one displays the relationship between a level one route and a parent route.  The figure is a chart that lists a network route as a level one route and below it is the title Parent Route if the level one network is a subnetted network. Figure two shows the output from the command, show i.p. route pipe begin Gateway. Two parent routes are highlighted.  The first route reads 172 dot 16 dot zero dot zero slash 16 is variably subnetted, 5 subnets, and 3 masks.  Below this the five subnets are listed along with the next hop I.P. address.  For example, one of the subnet lines reads R for RIP, 172 dot 16 dot 2 dot 0 slash 24 120 slash 2 via 209 dot 165 dot 200 dot 226.
