Figure two shows three routers connected in a triangle design through serial WAN links. Each router is connected to the other two routers.  Each router has two active serial links plus an Ethernet interface, and there are six total network addresses in the figure.  Figure is an animation that shows the process of a link-state routing protocol detecting a failure of a directly connected network and immediately sending out link updates altering other routers of the failure.
