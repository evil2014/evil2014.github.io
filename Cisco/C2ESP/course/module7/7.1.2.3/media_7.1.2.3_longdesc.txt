Figure one shows seven routers organized in a partial mesh with eleven WAN links and 16 local networks on the Ethernet interfaces.  This figure is an example of a network that would be difficult to maintain through the use of solely static routing. Figure two adds three more regions of seven routers for a total of twenty-eight routers and a large number of WAN links and local networks.  This network would be next to impossible to maintain solely through static routing.
