Figure one shows the output of the command, show i.p.v.6. protocols.  The figure highlights the output listing the i.p.v.6. routing protocol and the interfaces involved. Figure two shows the output from the command, show i.p.v.6. route. The figure highlights two routes that were learned through RIP. Figure three shows the output from the command, show i.p.v.6. route rip, which results in only the RIP routes being listed. Figure four is an interactive media element that allows the learner to verify i.p.v.6. protocol settings on a router.
