Figure is a close up view of a remote network entry in the routing table.  The line reads R for RIP as the route source, 172 dot 16 dot 4 dot 0 slash 28 for the destination network, 120 slash 2 for the administrative distance of RIP, the number of router hops away the network is, and this is the metric.  The line continues with 209 dot 165 dot 200 dot 226 for the next hop I.P. address, zero zero colon zero zero colon twelve for the time stamp of the update, and lastly serial zero slash zero slash zero for the outgoing interface.
