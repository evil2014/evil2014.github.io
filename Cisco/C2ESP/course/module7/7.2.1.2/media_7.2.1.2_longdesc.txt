Figure lists the purpose of routing algorithms, which is to send and receive updates, to calculate the best path and install routes in the table, and to detect and react to topology changes.  The figure is an animation that shows two routers sending each other periodic updates, calculating best routers, and maintaining the routing table.  The animation also shows a network failing and the router that it is connected to sending out an update alerting the other router of the failure.
