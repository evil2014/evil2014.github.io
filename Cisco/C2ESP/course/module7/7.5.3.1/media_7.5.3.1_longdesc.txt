Figure one shows a flow graphic for matching routes. In the figure, if the level one ultimate route is the best match, then the packet is routed following either the next hop I.P. address or the exit interface. Figure two displays the process if the best match for a packet is a level one parent route.  If a match with a level 2 child route is found, then the packet is routed following either the next hop I.P. address or the exit interface.  Figure three shows the process if no match with a level 2 child route is met, which is to search supernet routes including the default route in the routing table.  If no match is found then the packet is dropped.
