Figure one shows 4 routers in a diamond pattern. Each router is directly connected to its two neighboring routers.  There is one router in the middle and it is connected to two of the other routers.  The figure has link costs on each link between routers.  The figure focuses on router R-1, which has three active serial WAN links and a local network on a Fast Ethernet interface.  Each link has a cost listed next to the link.  Figure two lists information for the Fast Ethernet interface of router R-1.  Its I.P. address is 10 dot 1 dot 0 dot 1, it is on network 10 dot 1 dot zero dot zero slash 16, and it has a cost of 2.Figure three lists information for the serial zero slash zero slash zero interface of router R-1.  Its I.P. address is 10 dot 2 dot 0 dot 1, it is on network 10 dot 2 dot zero dot zero slash 16, it has a cost of 20, and it has router R-2 as a neighbor router. Figure four lists information for the serial zero slash zero slash zero interface of router R-1.  Its I.P. address is 10 dot 3 dot 0 dot 1, it is on network 10 dot 3 dot zero dot zero slash 16, it has a cost of 5, and it has router R-3 as a neighbor router. Figure five lists information for the serial zero slash zero slash zero interface of router R-1.  Its I.P. address is 10 dot 4 dot 0 dot 1, it is on network 10 dot 4 dot zero dot zero slash 16, it has a cost of 20, and it has router R-4 as a neighbor router.
