Figure one shows three routers connected linearly through WAN links.  R1 is connected to R2 through a serial WAN link, and it has a LAN on its gigabit-Ethernet interface.  R2 is connected to both R1 and R3 through serial WAN links, and also has a LAN on its gigabit-Ethernet interface.  R3 is only connected to R2 through a serial WAN link, and a LAN on its gigabit-Ethernet interface.  There are five different network addresses in the figure.  Figure two shows the commands required to set a passive interface.  The commands begin in global configuration mode and then enables rip routing.  The next command disables RIP updates from being sent out a specified interface, and the command used is passive hyphen interface g zero slash zero.  This is confirmed with the show i.p. protocols pipe begin Default command and the section titled Passive Interfaces is highlighted where the gigabit Ethernet zero slash zero interface is listed. Figure three is an interactive media element that allows the learner to configure rip routing and set a passive interface on a router.
