Figure shows four separate networks interconnected through WAN links.  In the figure, two networks are using O.S.P.F. internally, one is using E.I.G.R.P., and the other is using I.S.-I.S. The WAN links connecting them are all using B.G.P.  One of the O.S.P.F. networks has a stub network attached that is using RIP.  This network utilizes static routing for network access.
