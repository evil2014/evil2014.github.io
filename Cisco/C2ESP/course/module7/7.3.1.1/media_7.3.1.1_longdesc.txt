Figure one shows three routers connected linearly through WAN links.  R1 is connected to R2 through a serial WAN link, and it has a LAN on its gigabit-Ethernet interface.  R2 is connected to both R1 and R3 through serial WAN links, and also has a LAN on its gigabit-Ethernet interface.  R3 is only connected to R2 through a serial WAN link, and a LAN on its gigabit-Ethernet interface.  There are five different network addresses in the figure.  Figure two shows a simplified routing table for the network.  Routers R-1 and R-3 each have 2 directly connected networks and router R-2 has three.  Figure three shows the commands used to activate RIP on a router.  The figure begins in privileged exec mode, and the first command is config t, which moves to global configuration mode.  The next command is router rip, which activates RIP on the router and places the prompt at router-rip. Figure four shows the output from entering a question mark at the router-rip prompt.  This command results in the router listing all the commands that can be entered while at router-rip prompt.
