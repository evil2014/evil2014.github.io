Figure one shows three routers connected linearly through WAN links.  R-1 is connected to R-2 through a serial WAN link, and it has a LAN on an Ethernet interface.  The LAN is network address 172 dot 16 dot 1 dot 0 slash 24.  The WAN link is network 192 dot 168 dot 1 dot 0 slash 24.  R-2 is connected to R3 is through a serial WAN link, and the network address is 192 dot 168 dot 1 dot 0 slash 24.  R-3 has a LAN on an Ethernet interface with network address 172 dot 16 dot 2 dot 0 slash 24.  R-1 is running RIP version 1. Therefore, after every 30 second time period it sends a routing update consisting of the network address 172 dot 16 dot 1 dot 0 without the subnet mask.  Figure two shows R-2 receiving the update and adding the network advertised by R-1 to its routing table, and since it is a class B network the address that is added is 172 dot 16 dot 0 dot 0.  It will add the subnet mask of a slash 16 to the table since the network is a class B network.  Note that the actual network on R1 is using a slash 24.Figure three shows R-3 running RIP version 1. Therefore, after every 30 second time period it sends a routing update consisting of the network address 172 dot 16 dot 2 dot 0 without the subnet mask.  Figure four shows R2 receiving the update and adding the network advertised by R-3 to its routing table, and since it is a class B network the address that is added is 172 dot 16 dot 0 dot 0.  It will add the subnet mask of a slash 16 to the table since the network is a class B network.  Figure five shows the result of a ping and a trace route being sent from R-2 to the address 172 dot 16 dot 1 dot 1.  Some of the pings are received and some are lost.  These results are due to the fact that R-2 has two routes to the 172 dot 16 dot 1 dot 1 host because the routing table shows the class B network of 172 dot 16 dot 0 dot 0 is reachable from both the serial zero slash zero slash zero interface and the serial zero slash zero slash one interface.
