Figure shows two routers connected by a serial WAN link.  Each router has 2 local networks on the gigabit Ethernet ports.  The figure identifies the left router as R-1 and the router on the right as R-2.  The figure explains that R-2 is connected to the Internet and is the only path for data to leave from R-1. Therefore, R-1 will have a default static route that signifies this.  R-2 knows that there are only two networks attached to R-1, so it requires 2 static route entries in the routing table to reach those two networks.
