Figure shows 4 routers in a diamond pattern. Each router is directly connected to its two neighboring routers.  There is one router in the middle, and it is connected to two of the other routers.  The figure has link costs on each link between routers, which is the basis of the Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path First Algorithm.  An example is listed that shows 2 routes for data to travel between router R-2 and router R-4.  One path has a cost of 20 for link one, plus a cost of 20 for link 2, for a total cost of 40.  The second path has a cost of 20 for link one, plus a cost of 5 for link 2, plus a cost of 10 for link three, for a total cost of 35.  The latter path will be selected because of the lower path cost, even though it involves one more router.
