Figure one shows the basic information in the routing table for each router.  Each router has all four networks in its table. The only difference between them is the hop count for each network.  R-1 sees its two networks with a hop count of zero, the WAN link between R-2 and R-3 is one hop away, and the LAN off of the Ethernet interface of R-3 is two hops away.  R-2 sees its two networks with a hop count of zero, and each of the LANs off of the Ethernet interfaces of R-1 and R-3 as one hop away.  R-3 sees its two networks with a hop count of zero, the WAN link between R-2 and R-1 is one hop away, and the LAN off of the Ethernet interface of R-1 is two hops away. Figure two shows three routers connected in a triangle design through serial WAN links. Each router is connected to the other two routers.  Each router has two active serial links plus an Ethernet interface, and there are six total network addresses in the figure.  Convergence is the time it takes for all routers to have a complete and accurate picture of the network in their routing tables.  If RIP was being utilized in this network and a network failed, it would be a longer convergence time than either E.I.G.R.P. or O.S.P.F.
