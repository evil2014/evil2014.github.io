Figure one lists three types of level one routes, and an example of each.  The first listing is 192 dot 168 dot 1 dot 0 slash 24, the second is 192 dot 168 dot 0 dot 0 slash 16, and the third example is the default route of 0 dot 0 dot 0 dot 0 slash 0.  These are all ultimate routes in a routing table when either the next hop I.P. address or the exit interface is listed in the routing table. Figure two shows the output from the command, show i.p. route pipe begin Gateway.  This shows the routing table for router R-1 and highlights two level one routes. One route is the static default route and the other is 192 dot 168 dot 0 dot 0 slash 16 reachable through 209 dot 165 dot 200 dot 226.
