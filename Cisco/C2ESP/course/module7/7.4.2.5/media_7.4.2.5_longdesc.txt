Figure one shows 4 routers in a diamond pattern. Each router is directly connected to its two neighboring routers.  There is one router in the middle, and it is connected to two of the other routers.  The figure is an animation that shows router R-1 sending out link state packets out all interfaces.  Each receiving router immediately flood the L.S.Ps. upon receiving them.
