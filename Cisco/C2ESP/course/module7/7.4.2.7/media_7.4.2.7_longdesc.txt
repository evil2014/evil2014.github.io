Figure one shows router R-1 with an active Fast Ethernet interface, and connected to three other routers over each of three WAN links.  The figure shows router R-1 building its link state database.  The first step is R-1 identifying what networks it is attached to and the cost for each network on that link.  For example, R-1 is connected to network 10 dot 1 dot zero dot zero slash 16, with a cost of 2.  It is also connected to network 10 dot 2 dot zero dot zero slash 16 with a cost of 20, network 10 dot 3 dot zero dot zero slash 16 with a cost of 5, and network 10 dot 4 dot zero dot zero slash 16 with a cost of 20.Figure two shows router R-1 processing the information received in an L.S.P. received from router R-2.  R-1 will add any new networks to its database, but will ignore any networks that already exist in the database. Figure three shows router R-1 processing the information received in an L.S.P. received from router R-3.  R-1 will add any new networks to its database, but will ignore any networks that already exist in the database. Figure four shows router R-1 processing the information received in an L.S.P. received from router R-4.  R-1 will add any new networks to its database, but will ignore any networks that already exist in the database. Figure five shows router R-1 processing the information received in an L.S.P. received from router R-2.  R-1 will add any new networks to its database, but will ignore any networks that already exist in the database. Figure six shows the resulting S.P.F. tree of router R-1.  This lists each destination network, the shortest path, and the associated cost.  For example, R-1 can reach network 10 dot 5 dot zero dot zero slash 16 through router R-2 with a cost of 22.
