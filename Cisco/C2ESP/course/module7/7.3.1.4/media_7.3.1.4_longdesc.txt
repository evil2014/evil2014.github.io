Figure one shows the output from the command show i.p. protocols and is highlighting the section that states the router is sending version one, but can receive version one and version two updates. Figure two shows the commands to enable RIP version 2 on a router.  The figure begins in global configuration mode and enables RIP with the command router rip.  The next command is version 2, which enables RIP version 2 and disables RIP version 1.  The result from the command show i.p. protocols is shown, and now the router is sending and receiving only version 2 of RIP. Figure three shows the output from the show i.p. route pipe begin Gateway command. This shows the routing table, which has no RIP routes because in the previous figure the version 2 command enabled only version 2 on the router and RIP version 1 updates are now ignored. Figure four is an interactive media element that allows the learner to configure RIP version 2 on a router.
