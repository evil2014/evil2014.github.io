Figure one is a top-down chart that classifies dynamic routing protocols.  The chart breaks them down into interior gateway protocols and exterior gateway protocols.  The interior gateway protocols are further broken down into distance vector routing protocols and link-state routing protocols.  The distance vector protocols are RIP version 1 and 2, and E.I.G.R.P.  The link-state routing protocols are O.S.P.F. and I.S.-I.S.  Exterior routing protocols are considered path-vector routing protocols and the only one is B.G.P. Figures two through five highlight each layer explained in figure one.
