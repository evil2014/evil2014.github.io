Figure one is an interactive timeline for the evolution of routing protocols beginning with the Exterior Gateway Protocol in the year 1980 through the development of E.I.G.R.P for I.P.v.6. in 2005.  Other notable events include the release of Routing Information Protocol version 1 in 1988, followed by O.S.P.F. version 1 in 1989, and version 2 in 1991.  1992 saw the release of E.I.G.R.P. and 1993 saw R.I.P. version 2.  R.I.P. next generation for I.P.v.6. came out in 1997, followed by Version 3 of O.S.P.F. in 1999.Figure two is a table that organizes the routing protocols into interior routing protocols and exterior routing protocols, and classifies each as either used for I.P. version 4 or I.P. version 6.
