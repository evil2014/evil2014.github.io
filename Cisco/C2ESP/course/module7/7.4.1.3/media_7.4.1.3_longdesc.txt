Figure one shows 4 routers in a diamond pattern. Each router is directly connected to its two neighboring routers.  There is one router in the middle, and it is connected to two of the other routers.  The figure has link costs on each link between routers. There is a chart in the figure for R-1 to reach local networks on each of the other four routers and the total cost involved.  The purpose of the chart is to demonstrate that the best route when using the Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path First Algorithm is not always the least number of routers.  For example, for router R-1 to send data to the LAN, on the directly connected router R-4, there are two paths. One path is a direct route with a cost of 20 and the other path is a route going through router R-3 with a cost of 5, plus the cost of R-3 to R-4 of 10.  The total cost of going through R-3 is 15.  Therefore, the best choice is to go through router R-3 first due to its lower total cost.  Figure two lists the Shortest Path First chart for router R-2.Figure three lists the Shortest Path First chart for router R-3.Figure four lists the Shortest Path First chart for router R-4.Figure five lists the Shortest Path First chart for router R-5.
