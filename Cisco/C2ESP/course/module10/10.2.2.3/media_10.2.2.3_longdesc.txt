Figure one shows the output from the command, show i.p.v.6. d.h.c.p. pool.  This shows the d.h.c.p.v.6. configuration on the router. Figure two shows the output from the command, show i.p.v.6. interface g zero slash one.  The lines that state that the router has stateless address autoconfig enabled, the i.p.v.6. address, and the default router address configuration are highlighted in the figure. Figure three shows the output from the command, debug i.p.v.6. d.h.c.p. detail.  All of the d.h.c.p.v.6. messages sent between the client and the server including the d.n.s. server and domain name options that were configured on the server are highlighted in the figure. Figure four is an interactive activity that allows the learner to configure and verify stateless d.h.c.p.v.6. on a router.
