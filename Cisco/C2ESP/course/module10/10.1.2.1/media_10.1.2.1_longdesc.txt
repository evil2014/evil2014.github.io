Figure one shows a network topology of three routers.  R-2 is in the middle and has a serial WAN link to R-1 and a serial WAN link to R-3.  R-1 and R-3 are not directly connected.  R-1 has two active gigabit Ethernet LANs. Each of these LANs has a switch connected to them, and each switch is connected to a computer. There is also a d.h.c.p. server connected to S-2.  R-3 has one active gigabit Ethernet LAN, which contains a switch and a computer. Figure two shows the commands used to exclude specific addresses from a d.h.c.p. pool.  The command is, i.p. d.h.c.p. excluded hyphen address.  This is immediately followed with either the specific address or the address range.  Two examples are listed. The first example lists a range and the command is, i.p. d.h.c.p. excluded hyphen address 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot 1 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot 9.  The second example lists a single address and the command is, i.p. d.h.c.p. excluded hyphen address 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot 254.Figure three shows the command used to create the d.h.c.p. pool. The command is, i.p. d.h.c.p. pool followed by the pool name.  The example is, i.p. d.h.c.p. pool LAN hyphen POOL hyphen 1.Figure four lists two required parameters when configuring d.h.c.p. These two parameters are defining the address pool and defining the default router or gateway.  Optional tasks include defining a d.n.s. server, defining a domain name, setting a d.h.c.p. lease time, and defining a net bios w.i.n.s. server. Figure five continues the d.h.c.p. configuration example.  The next command sets the network range and the command is, network 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot zero.  The next command is, default hyphen router 192 dot 168 11 dot 5.  The d.n.s. server is configured with the command, domain hyphen name example dot com. Figure six is an interactive activity that allows the learner to configure a router as a d.h.c.p.v.4. server.
