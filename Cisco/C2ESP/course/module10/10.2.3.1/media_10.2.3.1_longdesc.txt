Figure one shows the commands used to configure a stateful d.h.c.p.v.6. router.  The first command is, i.p.v.6. unicast hyphen routing.  Next, the pool is created with the command, i.p.v.6. d.h.c.p. pool, and then the pool name follows.  The next command is, address prefix slash. This is followed by the prefix length.  The d.n.s. server is configured with the command, d.n.s. hyphen server, followed by the address.  The domain name can also be configured with the command, domain hyphen name, followed by the domain name.  The next command binds the d.h.c.p.v.6. pool to an interface. The command is, i.p.v.6. d.h.c.p. server, followed by the pool name.  The last command is, i.p.v.6. n.d. managed hyphen config hyphen flag. Figure two shows a full example of configuring a router as a stateful d.h.c.p.v.6. server.  The example begins in global configuration mode and the commands used are as follows.  The first command is, i.p.v.6. unicast hyphen routing.  The next command is, d.h.c.p. pool i.p.v.6. hyphen stateful.  The next command is, address prefix 2 0 0 1 colon d b 8 colon c a f e colon 1 colon colon slash 64 lifetime infinite.  The next command is, d.n.s. hyphen server 2 0 0 1 colon d b 8 colon c a f e colon a a a a colon colon 5.  The next command is, domain hyphen name example dot com.  The d.h.c.p.v.6. pool has been configured and the next set of commands bind the pool to the interface.  The C.L.I. in the example moves to the local interface first with the command, exit. The exit command is followed by the command, interface g zero slash one.  The next command is, i.p.v.6. address 2 0 0 1 colon d b 8 colon c a f e colon 1 colon colon 1 slash 64.  The next command is, d.h.c.p. pool i.p.v.6.  hyphen stateful .  The last command is, i.p.v.6. n.d. managed hyphen config hyphen flag.
