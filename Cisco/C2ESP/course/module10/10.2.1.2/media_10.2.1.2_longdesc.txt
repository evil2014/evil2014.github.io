Figure one shows the same topology as the previous page. The computer is sending out the i.p.v.6. router solicitation message, which is an all routers multicast message. Figure two shows the router receives this message and responds with a router advertisement message. This message is an i.p.v.6. all nodes multicast message, and contains the prefix, prefix length, and other information for the client. Figure three shows the client creating an i.p.v.6. global unicast address by generating an interface i.d. and using the prefix and prefix length sent by the router. Figure four shows the computer sending out a duplicate address detection message after configuring its i.p.v.6. address.
