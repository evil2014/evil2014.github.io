Figure one shows a network topology of three routers.  R-2 is in the middle and has a serial WAN link to R-1 and a serial WAN link to R-3.  R-1 and R-3 are not directly connected.  R-1 has two active gigabit Ethernet LANs. Each of these LANs has a switch connected to them, and each switch is connected to a computer. There is also a d.h.c.p. server connected to S-2.  R-3 has one active gigabit Ethernet LAN, which contains a switch and a computer. Figure two shows the commands used to configure a d.h.c.p.v.6. relay agent.  The example begins in global configuration mode and first moves to the specific interface with the command, interface g zero slash zero.  The next command is, i.p.v.6. d.h.c.p. relay destination 2 0 0 1 colon d b 8 colon c a f e colon 1 colon colon 6.  The figure then shows the output from the command, show i.p.v.6. d.h.c.p. interface g zero slash zero.  This output states that the interface is in relay mode and lists the configured relay i.p. address. Figure three is an interactive activity that allows the learner to configure a d.h.c.p.v.6. relay agent.
