Figure one shows the same topology as figure one on the previous page. Figure two shows the output from the command, show running hyphen config pipe section d.h.c.p.  The output is the d.h.c.p. configuration on the router. Figure three shows the output from the command, show i.p. d.h.c.p. binding.  The output lists all i.p. and MAC address binding, and the example in the figure is an empty list.  The figure also shows the output from the command, show i.p. d.h.c.p. server statistics.  This command will display count information regarding the number of D.H.C.P.v.4 messages that have been sent and received. The example shows that one d.h.c.p. pool has been configured, but no messages have been sent or received. Figure four shows the output from the commands on the previous pages after two client computers have been powered on.  The two computers are now listed in the binding table with the assigned i.p. address listed with the mac address of each computer.  The statistics output lists eight d.h.c.p. discover messages and three d.h.c.p. request messages received by the router. Three d.h.c.p. offer messages and three d.h.c.p. ack messages were sent by the router. Figure five shows the output of the command, i.p. config, being run on a computer.  The figure highlights the domain name, the i.p. address, the d.n.s. server, and the default gateway values. All of these have been provided by the d.h.c.p. server.
