The command is run from the interface configuration mode and the example begins in global configuration mode.  The first command shown, is interface g zero slash one.  The next command is, i.p. address d.h.c.p.  The figure then shows the output from the command, show i.p. interface g zero slash one. This command lists an i.p. address and a line that states that the address is determined by d.h.c.p.
