Figure shows an extended A.C.L. permitting only packets with u.d.p. destination ports of 67 or 68.  The first command is, access hyphen list 100 permit u.d.p. any e.q. 67.  The second line of the A.C.L. is, access hyphen list 100 permit u.d.p. any e.q. 68.  The figure then runs the command, debug i.p. packet 100.  This is used to view activity that matches A.C.L. 100, which is the A.C.L. configured to allow d.h.c.p.  The figure shows the router receiving two broadcast packets from source i.p. 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 255, which are d.h.c.p. requests.  The last command in the figure is, debug i.p. d.h.c.p. server events.  This command will report server events, and in the figure d.h.c.p. activity on the server is displayed.  This activity includes an i.p. address being returned to the pool, and an i.p. address being assigned.
