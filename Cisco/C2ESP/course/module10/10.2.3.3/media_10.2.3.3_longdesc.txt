Figure one shows two routers connected to the same switch.  Router one is configured as a stateful d.h.c.p.v.6. server, and router three is a d.h.c.p.v.6. client.  The figure shows the C.L.I. for router one and shows the output from the command, show i.p.v.6. d.h.c.p. pool.  The address allocation prefix and the line that lists one active client are highlighted in this figure. Figure two shows the output from the command, show i.p.v.6. d.h.c.p. binding.  The link local address of router three and the d.h.c.p.v.6 address assigned to it by router one are highlighted in this figure.  Figure three shows router three running the command, show i.p.v.6. interface g zero slash one. The i.p.v.6. address and the default router address assigned by the d.h.c.p.v.6. server are highlighted in this figure. Figure four is an interactive activity that allows the learner to configure and verify stateless d.h.c.p.v.6. on a router.
