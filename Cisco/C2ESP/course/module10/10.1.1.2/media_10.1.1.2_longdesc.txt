Figure one is showing the d.h.c.p. process, which consists of a client configured for d.h.c.p. looking for an address and a d.h.c.p. server is providing an address to the client.  Figure two shows step one of the process in which a client computer is sending out a broadcast message asking for an i.p. address.  This is the d.h.c.p. discover. Figure three shows step two of the process in which the server identified itself as a d.h.c.p. server and offers an i.p. address to the client. This is a unicast message and is the d.h.c.p. offer. Figure four shows step three in which the client sends a broadcast message accepting the offered i.p address. This is the d.h.c.p. request. Figure five shows the final step in which the server sends a unicast message to the client acknowledging the client accepting the address.  This is the d.h.c.p. ack. Figure six is showing the client sending a unicast message to the server requesting to renew the current lease. Figure seven shows the server acknowledge the lease renewal request.
