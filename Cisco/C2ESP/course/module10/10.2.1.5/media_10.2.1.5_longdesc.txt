Figure shows the stateless d.h.c.p.v.6. process for a computer.  The router sends a router advertisement message containing some addressing information needed by the computer, and a directive to the computer that it must find a d.h.c.p.v.6. server for the remaining information.  This is in response to the router solicitation message sent by the computer.
