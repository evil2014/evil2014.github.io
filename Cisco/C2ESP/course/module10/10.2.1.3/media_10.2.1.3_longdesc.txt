Figure shows the three router advertisement message options.  The first is S.L.A.A.C., in which the router directs the computer to only use the information in the R.A. message. This is the default setting.  The second option is stateless d.h.c.p.v.6. using both S.L.A.A.C. and d.h.c.p.  In this option, the router gives information in a router advertisement message, but also instructs the computer to obtain some information from a d.h.c.p.v.6. server.  Option three is stateful d.h.c.p. In this option, the router instructs the computer to obtain all information from a d.h.c.p.v.6. server.
