Figure one shows the commands used to configure stateless d.h.c.p.v.6. on a router.  The figure begins in global configuration mode and the first command is, i.p.v.6. unicast hyphen routing.  This command enables i.p.v.6. routing.  The next command is, i.p.v.6. d.h.c.p. pool, and then the pool name follows.  A d.n.s. server is configured with the command, d.n.s. hyphen server. The domain name is configured with the command, domain hyphen name.  An interface is configured with the d.h.c.p. pool with the command, i.p.v.6. d.h.c.p. server, followed by the pool name.  The last command is, i.p.v.6. n.d. other hyphen config hyphen flag. Figure two shows a full example of configuring a router as a stateless d.h.c.p.v.6. server.  The figure begins in global configuration mode and the commands are as follows.  The first command is, i.p.v.6. unicast hyphen routing.  The next command is, d.h.c.p. pool i.p.v.6. hyphen stateless.  The next command is d.n.s. hyphen server 2 0 0 1 colon d b 8 colon c a f e colon a a a a colon colon 5.  The next command is, domain hyphen name example dot com.  The d.h.c.p.v.6. pool has been configured and the next set of commands binds the pool to the interface.  The C.L.I. in the example moves to the local interface first with the command, exit. The exist command is followed by the command, interface g zero slash one.  The next command is, i.p.v.6. address 2 0 0 1 colon d b 8 colon c a f e colon 1 colon colon 1 slash 64.  The next command is, d.h.c.p. pool i.p.v.6.  hyphen stateless.  The last command is, i.p.v.6. n.d. other hyphen config hyphen flag.
