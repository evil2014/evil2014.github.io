Figure one shows the same topology from the previous page. In this instance, a computer is looking for a d.h.c.p. server, but there isnâ€™t a d.h.c.p. server on the local segment. By default, a router will not forward the d.h.c.p. discover message because it is a broadcast message. Figure two shows the output of the command, i.p. config, being run on a computer that cannot find a d.h.c.p. server.  The address is zero dot zero dot zero dot zero because the computer is not able to communicate with a d.h.c.p. server. Figure three shows the commands used to configure a router as a d.h.c.p. helper.  The command is configured at the interface level. From global configuration mode the first command is, interface g zero slash zero.  The next command is, i.p. helper hyphen address 192 dot 168 dot 11 dot 6.  The command, show i.p. interface g zero slash zero, is run and the helper address is listed in the configuration of the interface. Figure four shows the output from the command, i.p. config, being run on the computer that does not have a d.h.c.p. on the local link and relies on the router acting as a relay agent.  The output lists an i.p. address for the computer, which means that the relay agent worked. Figure five is an interactive activity that allows the learner to configure a router as a d.h.c.p. relay agent.
