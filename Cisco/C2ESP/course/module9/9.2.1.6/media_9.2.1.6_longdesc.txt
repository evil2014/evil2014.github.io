Figure shows the commands required to configure an A.C.L. to deny a specific host while permitting a specific subnet.  The commands begin in global configuration mode. The first command removes the previous A.C.L. The command is, no access hyphen list 1.  The next command is, access hyphen list 1 deny host 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot 10.  The A.C.L. is configured to permit the network with the command, access hyphen list 1 permit 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero zero dot zero dot zero dot 255.  The command moves to the WAN interface via the command, interface serial zero slash zero slash zero.  Lastly the A.C.L. is applied to the interface in the outbound direction via the command, i.p. access hyphen group 1 out.
