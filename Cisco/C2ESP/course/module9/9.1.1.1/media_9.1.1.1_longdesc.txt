Figure shows a router labeled R-2 with a serial WAN link to the Internet. The router has an A.C.L. placed on the serial interface.  The A.C.L. allows incoming e mail, but it blocks incoming telnet requests.  There are two more active serial WAN links on the router, and each of these two serial WAN links connects to routers R-1 and R-3.  R-1 and R-3 have LAN interfaces that connect to switches. There are A.C.L.s configured on the LAN interfaces.  The A.C.L. on router R-1 is denying video traffic going toward the connected switch. R-1 is also denying the switch to make a connection to the switch on the other LAN interface.  R-3 has two LAN interfaces. One LAN interface is connected to a switch, and a serial WAN link is attached to an internal subnet.  There is an A.C.L. on the internal subnet link that denies all traffic coming from the router directed toward the subnet. Therefore, only data originating within the subnet is allowed to leave the network.  The LAN interface has an A.C.L. that denies any updates, F.T.P., or web traffic.
