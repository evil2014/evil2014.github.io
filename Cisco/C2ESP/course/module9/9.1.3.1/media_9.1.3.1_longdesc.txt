Figure one shows five 8 bit wildcard masks.  Example one is, zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero, which will match all address bits in the octet.  Example two is, zero zero one one one one one one, which will match the first two bits and ignore that last six address bits.  Example three is zero zero zero zero one one one one will match the first four bits and ignore the last four bits.  Example four is one one one one one one zero zero, which will ignore the first six address bits and match the last two.  Example five is one one one one one one one one, which will ignore all the bits in the octet. Figure two shows the results of applying a zero dot zero dot 255 dot 255 wildcard mask to a 32-bit I.P.v.4. address.  The wildcard mask is listed as 16 zero bits followed by 16 one bits.  This will result in the matching of the first two octets in an address and ignoring the last two octets.
