Figure one shows the common command syntax and options for an extended A.C.L.  The command needs to be either a permit or deny statement, the protocol, the source and destination addresses, an operator such as equals, and the optional port. Figure two shows an example configuration of an extended A.C.L.  The first command is, access hyphen list 103 permit t.c.p. 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero zero dot zero dot zero dot 255 any e.q. 80.  This will block basic web page data.  The next line will allow secure web traffic, and the command is, access hyphen list 103 permit t.c.p. 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero zero dot zero dot zero dot 255 any e.q. 443.  The last A.C.L. configuration command creates a new A.C.L. that is an optional command that allows only return data that is responding to an established connection.  The command is, access hyphen list 104 permit t.c.p. 192 dot 168 dot 20 dot zero zero dot zero dot zero dot 255 established.  The first A.C.L. is then applied to the gigabit Ethernet interface that has a network segment, and it is applied in the inbound direction.  This will inspect traffic as it leaves the segment and arrives at the router.  The second A.C.L. is applied to the same interface, but in the outbound direction, therefore examining traffic as it heads toward the network segment.
