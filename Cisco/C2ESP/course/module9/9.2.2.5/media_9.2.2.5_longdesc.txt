Figure one shows how to view A.C.L. statistics.  The figure shows the output from the privileged exec mode command, show access hyphen lists.  The output lists the lines for each A.C.L. and the number of matches for each line.  For example, line 10 of A.C.L. number 1 is displayed followed by the following words, 4 matches.  This means that there have been four packets that met the condition of line 10.  In the figure, a ping is sent that will match the condition of line 10 and when the statistics are viewed; the number of matches has increased. Figure two shows the use of the command, clear access hyphen list counters 1. The output from the command, show access hyphen lists, no longer lists any matches for the A.C.L.
