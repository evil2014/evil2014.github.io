Figure shows a flow chart depicting the standard A.C.L. logic.  The first question in the chart checks to see if the source I.P. address is a match. If it is a match, the packet is denied as specified.  If it is not a match, the next line in the A.C.L. is processed.  These steps continue for each line in the A.C.L. until the implicit deny is reached as described in the text.
