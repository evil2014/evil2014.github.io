Figure is a flow chart used to represent the process of packet filtering. In the example, the A.C.L. is designed to look for packets requesting port 80 web services.  The first step is to determine which network the packet is coming from by looking at the frame header.  In the figure, there are two options, network A and network B.  Once the source network is determined, the next step is to determine whether the packet is requesting port 80 services by examining the T.C.P. header.  If the packet is from network A and is asking for port 80, the packet will be allowed.  If the packet is not asking for port 80, it will be denied.  The opposite is true for packets coming from network B. If the packet is from network B and is requesting port 80, the packet will be denied and all other requests will be allowed.
