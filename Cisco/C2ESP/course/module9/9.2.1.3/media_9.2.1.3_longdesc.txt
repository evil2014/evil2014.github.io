Figure one lists the command syntax for standard A.C.L.s.  The main parameters are the access hyphen list command followed by a number, either a permit or deny statement, the source and destination I.P. addresses, and the optional wildcard mask.  Other options include a remark statement used to document the A.C.L. and the keyword log which is used to send messages about packets that match the A.C.L. to the console. Figure two shows the creation of a standard A.C.L., access hyphen list ten permit 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero zero zero zero 255.  The I.O.S. has a command run from privilege exec mode that will display all the access lists on a router. That command, is show access hyphen list.  The process of removing an A.C.L. from a router is done in global configuration mode. The command is, no access hyphen list, followed by the A.C.L. number to be removed. Figure three shows the use of the keyword, remark.  The command is, access hyphen list 10 remark permit hosts from the 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero LAN.  This command is followed by the A.C.L. configuration command, access hyphen list ten permit 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero zero dot zero dot zero dot 255.  The figure shows the final A.C.L. and it shows that the remark is listed in the configuration file to serve as documentation of the purpose of the A.C.L.
