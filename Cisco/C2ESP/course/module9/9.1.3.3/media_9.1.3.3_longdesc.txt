Figure shows three examples for calculating wildcard masks using the subtraction from all 255s method.  In the first example, there are four sets of 255 and below that the I.P.v.4. subnet mask is listed.  The subnet mask is then subtracted from the four sets of 255, which results in the wildcard mask.  The figure lists 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 255 minus 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot zero.  This will result in zero dot zero dot zero dot 255 as the wildcard mask.  Example two shows how to calculate a wildcard mask for a slash 28 network.  The figure lists 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 255 minus 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 240.  This will result in zero dot zero dot zero dot 15 as the wildcard mask.  Example three shows how to calculate a wildcard mask for a slash 23 subnet mask.  The figure lists 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 255 minus 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 254.  This will result in zero dot zero dot 1 dot 255 as the wildcard mask.
