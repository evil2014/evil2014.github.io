Figure shows the topology from the previous page, and the commands used to apply an A.C.L. to an interface.  Once the A.C.L. is created it is applied to the desired interface and in a particular direction.  The first step is to access the desired interface. In this example the command is, interface zero slash zero.  The A.C.L. is applied with the command, i.p. access hyphen group 103 in.  The second A.C.L. is placed on the same interface, but in the outbound direction with the command, i.p. access hyphen group out.
