Figure one shows the contents of an A.C.L. that first denies three network range addresses, and then specifically allows five host i.p. addresses.  When the command, show running hyphen config, is run the A.C.L. statements are placed in the following order: the five permit host entries are first, followed by the three deny range statements.  Figure two shows the output from the command, show access hyphen list 1.  This output lists the five permit host entries first, and then the three deny range statements.  Each statement retains its original sequence number as entered.  The figure continues with saving the configuration file, rebooting the router, and then displays the configuration file.  The A.C.L. is still ordered with the host entries first followed by the network ranges, but now the sequence numbers have been rewritten to match the order.  This shows that the router changes the order and the sequence number in order to maximize efficiency.
