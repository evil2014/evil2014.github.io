Figure one is showing the reference topology for i.p.v.6. A.C.L.s. Figure two lists the commands used to create an A.C.L. that will deny f.t.p.  The commands begin in global configuration mode. The first command is, i.p.v.6. access hyphen list no hyphen f.t.p. hyphen to hyphen 11.  This command creates the named i.p.v.6. A.C.L.  The next two commands deny the f.t.p. protocol, and they are, deny t.c.p. any 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon C A F E colon 1 1 colon colon slash 64 e.q. f.t.p., and deny t.c.p. any 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon C A F E colon 1 1 colon colon slash 64 e.q. f.t.p. hyphen data.  The next command allows other data traffic and the command is, permit i.p.v.6. any any.  The next command moves to the appropriate interface with the command interface gigabit Ethernet zero slash zero.  The last command applies the A.C.L. to the interface, and it is, i.p.v.6. traffic hyphen filter no hyphen f.t.p. hyphen to hyphen 11 in. Figure three shows a detailed example of an A.C.L. used for restricting access.  First an A.C.L. is created via the command, i.p.v.6. access hyphen list restricted hyphen access.  Next a remark is entered with the command, remark permit access only h.t.t.p. and h.t.t.p.s to network.  The following two permits statements follow, permit t.c.p. any host 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon C A F E colon 1 0 colon colon 10 e.q. 80 and the command permit t.c.p. any host 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon C A F E colon 1 0 colon colon 10 e.q. 443.  These two lines are referred to in comment 1 in the text.  Comment two in the text refers to the command, deny i.p.v.6. any 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon C A F E colon 1 0 colon colon slash 64.  This blocks all other traffic.  Comment 3 in the text is for the command, permit t.c.p. host 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon C A F E colon 3 0 colon colon 12 host 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon C A F E colon 1 1 colon colon 11 e.q. 23.  This line permits a specific computer access to another specific computer.  Comment 4 in the text is for the command, deny t.c.p. any host 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon C A F E colon 1 1 colon colon 11 e.q. 23.  This line blocks all other telnet traffic.  All other i.p. traffic is allowed with the command, permit i.p.v.6. any any.  The last comment is number 5 and it is for the command, i.p.v.6. traffic hyphen filter restricted hyphen acess in.  This line applies the named i.p.v.6. A.C.L. to the gigabit Ethernet zero slash zero interface in the inbound direction.
