Figure one shows a router with a local network segment on each of two gigabit Ethernet interfaces.  Each segment consists of a switch and a computer.  The router has V.T.Y. ports zero through four configured for access.  The figure shows the commands required to create an A.C.L. that restricts V.T.Y. connections.  The figure begins in global configuration mode and then moves to the v.t.y. lines with the command, line v.t.y. zero space four.  The next command configures the router to use a local database for access with the command login local.  The next line sets the type of connection to allow. The command is, transport input s.s.h.  This is followed by applying an A.C.L. on the lines with the command, access hyphen class 21 in.  The figure moves from line configuration mode to global configuration mode with the command, exit.  The A.C.L. is created with the command, access hyphen list 21 permit 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero zero dot zero dot zero dot 255, and the command, access hyphen list 21 deny any. Figure two is an interactive media element that allows the learner to configure the v.t.y. lines to accept s.s.h. on a router.
