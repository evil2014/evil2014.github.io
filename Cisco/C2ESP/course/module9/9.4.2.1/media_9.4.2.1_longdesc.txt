Figure shows a network of three routers.  R-2 is at the top of a triangle layout and has a serial WAN connection to both R-1 and R-3.  There is no direct connection between R-1 and R-3.  Routers R-1 and R-3 each have two active gigabit interfaces for local network segments, and each segment has a switch with a computer connected to the switch.  R-1 has network 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero on interface gigabit zero slash zero, and network 192 dot 168 dot 11 dot zero on interface gigabit zero slash one.  R-3 has network 192 dot 168 dot 30 dot zero on interface gigabit zero slash zero, and network 192 dot 168 dot 31 dot zero on interface gigabit zero slash one.  All segments are class C networks with a slash 24.  This is the reference topology for the next series of pages.  This figure shows the output from the following command run on R-3, show access hyphen lists. There is one A.C.L. that has 3 statements.  The first is 10 deny t.c.p. 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero zero dot zero dot zero dot 255, and there have been 12 packet matches.  The second line is 20 permit t.c.p. 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero zero dot zero dot zero dot 255 any e.q. telnet, and there have been no matches. The last statement is 30 permit i.p. any any.  The fact that line 10 denies everything from the specified network causes line 20 to never have a match.  These two statements need to be reversed.
