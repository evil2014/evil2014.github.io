Figure shows the same topology as the previous page and the commands used to create an extended named A.C.L.  The first command is, i.p. access hyphen list extended surfing.  Next are two permits statements, and they are permit 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero zero dot zero dot zero dot zero any e.q. 80, and permit 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero zero dot zero dot zero dot zero any e.q. 443.  Another extended A.C.L. is created that allows the return traffic from established connections.  The first command creates the A.C.L. and it is, i.p. access hyphen list extended browsing.  Next is the permit statement, which is permit t.c.p. any 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero zero dot zero dot zero dot 255 established. The surfing A.C.L. for permitting traffic is placed on the gigabit Ethernet zero slash zero interface in the inbound direction with the command, i.p. access hyphen group surfing in.  The second A.C.L. is placed on the same interface, but in the outbound direction with the command, i.p. access hyphen group browsing out.
