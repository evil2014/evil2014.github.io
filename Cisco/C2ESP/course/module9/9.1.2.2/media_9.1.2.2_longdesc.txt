Figure summarizes the rules to follow when writing numbered A.C.L.s and named A.C.L.s.  A numbered A.C.L. will be assigned a number in the range 1 to 99 or the range 1,300 to 1,999 for a standard A.C.L.  An extended A.C.L. will be assigned a number in the range of 100 to 199 or 2,000 to 2,699.  A named A.C.L. can contain alphanumeric characters, but cannot contain spaces or punctuation.  The recommendation is to use all capital letters when creating a named A.C.L.  Another feature of an extended A.C.L. is that entries can be added or deleted within the A.C.L.
