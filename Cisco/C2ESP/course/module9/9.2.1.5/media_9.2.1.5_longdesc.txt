Figure one shows the application of an A.C.L. to an interface.  The first line creates an A.C.L. The next command moves to the interface on which the A.C.L. will be placed. The command is, interface serial zero slash zero slash zero.  Once in interface configuration mode the command used to apply an A.C.L. to the interface is, i.p. access hyphen group 1 out. Figure two shows a topology which depicts the steps and commands listed on figure one.
