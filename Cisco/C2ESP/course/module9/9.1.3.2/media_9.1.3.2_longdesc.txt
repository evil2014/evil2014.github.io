Figure one lists three examples of I.P.v.4. addresses and wildcard masks.  Example one has a wildcard mask of 32 zeros, therefore it instructs the A.C.L. to match the exact I.P. address.  Example two has a wildcard mask of 32 ones, therefore any I.P. address will be a match.  Example three has a wildcard mask of 24 zeros starting from the left and working right, followed by eight ones.  This effectively matches a class C network where the first 24 bits are matched.
