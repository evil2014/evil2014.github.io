Figure one shows a conflicting access list entry on a current A.C.L.  The first line is access hyphen list 3 deny 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero zero dot zero dot zero dot 255.  This is followed by the command access hyphen list 3 permit host 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot 10, which conflicts with the deny statement and causes an error message to be sent to the console. Figure two shows the same two commands used in the previous figure, but in opposite order. This command sequence is accepted by the router. Figure three shows two entries that do not conflict.  The first command is, access hyphen list 5 deny 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero zero dot zero dot zero dot 255.  This command is followed by, access hyphen list 5 permit host 192 dot 168 dot 11 dot 10.  The host is not affected by the network in the deny statement so it is accepted.
