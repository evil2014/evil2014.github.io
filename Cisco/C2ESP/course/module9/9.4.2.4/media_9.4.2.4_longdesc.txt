The figure is another example of an error in an A.C.L. and uses the same reference topology.  This figure shows the output from the following command run on R-3, show access hyphen lists 140. Access list number 140 is shown.  This particular A.C.L. has 2 statements.  The first is 10 deny t.c.p. 192 dot 168 dot 30 dot 1 any e.q. telnet.  The second line is 20 permit i.p. any any and has had 5 matches.  The A.C.L. should be denying the host address, which is 192 dot 168 dot 30 dot 12 slash 24, but instead it is blocking 192 dot 168 dot 30 dot 1.  So the error here is the wrong source address.
