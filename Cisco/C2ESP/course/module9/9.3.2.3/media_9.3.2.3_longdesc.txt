Figure one shows a router with a local network segment on each of two gigabit Ethernet interfaces.  Each segment consists of a switch and a computer.  The gigabit Ethernet zero slash zero interface is on the 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero network, and the zero slash one interface is on the 192 dot 168 dot 11 dot zero network.  The figure shows the creation of an A.C.L. that denies FTP traffic from the subnet dot 11 subnet going to the dot 10 subnet.  The first command for this A.C.L. is, access hyphen list 101 deny t.c.p. 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero zero dot zero dot zero dot 255 any e.q. f.t.p.  The next command is, access hyphen list 101 deny t.c.p. 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero zero dot zero dot zero dot 255 any e.q. f.t.p. hyphen data.  The last command permits all other traffic and it is, access hyphen list 101 permit i.p. any any.  The A.C.L. is then applied to the gigabit Ethernet interface in the inbound direction with the command, i.p. access hyphen group 101 in. Figure two shows an A.C.L. that denies Telnet traffic from any source to the 192 dot 168 dot 11 dot zero slash 24 LAN, but allows all other IP traffic.  The first command is, access hyphen list 102 deny t.c.p. any 192 dot 168 dot 11 dot zero zero dot zero dot zero dot 255 any e.q. 23.  The last command permits all other traffic and it is, access hyphen list 102 permit i.p. any any.  The A.C.L. is then applied to the gigabit Ethernet interface in the outbound direction with the command, i.p. access hyphen group 102 out.
