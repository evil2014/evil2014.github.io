Figure one is an animation that shows the steps involved in a T.C.P. conversation between devices.  These steps include the three way handshake of sending the T.C.P. synchronization, sending the acknowledgement, sending the data, and sending the FIN packets. Figure two shows the three ranges used for port numbers.  Ports 0 through 1023 are classified as well known ports.  Numbers 1024 through 49151 are registered ports.  Ports 49152 through 65535 are considered private and or dynamic ports. Figure three lists common ports and their services.  These include port 21 for F.T.P., port 23 for Telnet, port 25 for S.M.T.P., port 80 for H.T.T.P., port 143 for I.M.A.P., port 194 for Internet Relay Chat, and port 443 for H.T.T.P.S.  Common registered T.C.P. ports include: port 1863 for the M.S.N. Messenger service, port 2000 for Cisco S.C.C.P which is a V.O.I.P. service, and ports 8008 and 8080 which are alternate H.T.T.P. ports. Figure four lists two well-known U.D.P. ports, port 69 for T.F.T.P. and port 520 for the RIP, which is a routing protocol.  The following common registered U.D.P. ports are listed, port 1812 for the RADIUS Authentication service, port 5004 for R.T.P. used for video and voice transport, and port 5040 which is used in V.O.I.P. Figure five lists the following three services that use both T.C.P. and U.D.P. in the well-known port range: port 53 for D.N.S., port 161 for S.N.M.P., and port 531 for A.O.L. Instant Messenger.  Two services that use both T.C.P. and U.D.P. in the registered port range are Microsoft S.Q.L. on port 1433 and Multimedia Messaging Services on port 2948.
