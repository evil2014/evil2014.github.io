Figure shows a network of three routers in a triangle format.  R-2 is at the top of the triangle, and has a serial WAN connection to R-1 and R-3.  There is no direct connection between R-1 and R-3.  Routers R-1 and R-3 each have two active gigabit interfaces for local network segments.  The goal is to block all traffic originating from R-1 from reaching R-3. The A.C.L. is placed on the exit interface in the outbound direction on router R-3.
