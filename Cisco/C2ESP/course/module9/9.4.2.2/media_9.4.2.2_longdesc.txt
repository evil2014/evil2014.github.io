The figure is another example of an error in an A.C.L. and uses the same reference topology.  This figure shows the output from the following command run on R-1, show access hyphen lists 120. Access list number 120 is shown.  This particular A.C.L. has 3 statements.  The first is 10 deny t.c.p. 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero zero dot zero dot zero dot 255 any e.q. telnet.  The second line is 20 deny t.c.p. 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot zero zero dot zero dot zero dot 255 host 192 dot 168 dot 31 dot 12 e.q. s.m.t.p.  The last statement is 30 permit t.c.p. any any.  The fact that line 30 permits only t.c.p. traffic means it will block u.d.p. traffic.
