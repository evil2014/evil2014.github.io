These figures are based on the standard lab diagram.  R. 1. with a lan connects to R. 2. with a lan which connects to R. 3. with a lan. Figure one shows the output from the "show i. p. v. 6 route" command on router one. Figure two shows the output from the "show i. p. v. 6 route" command on router two. Figure three shows the output from the "show i. p. v. 6 route" command on router three. Figure four shows the result of using the "ping i. p. v. 6" command on router one to ping the next hop address on router two. Figure five shows the result of using the "ping i. p. v. 6" command on router one to ping the lan interface on router 3.  This ping is not successful as there is no route to this destination in the routing table on router one.
