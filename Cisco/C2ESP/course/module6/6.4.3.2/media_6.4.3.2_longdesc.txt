Figure one shows the standard lab diagram with an additional link between router one and router three.  The figure shows the syntax for creating a default static route on router one pointing to router two and another pointing to router three with a larger administrative distance of 5.  This makes the first route the preferred route and the second is a floating static route. Figure two shows the output of the "show i. p. route static" command on router one.  Only the first route is shown in the output since it is the preferred route. Figure three is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice configuring floating static routes.
