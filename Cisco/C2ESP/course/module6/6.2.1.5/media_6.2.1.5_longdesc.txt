These figures are based on the standard lab diagram.  R. 1. with a lan connects to R. 2. with a lan which connects to R. 3. with a lan. Figure one shows the configuring of the two lans that router 1 is not connected to, the router two lan and the router three lan, as well as the wan between router two and router three.  The static routes were configured using a fully qualified static route.  This type of route has exit interface and next hop address. Figure two demonstrates the lookup process for router one to reach the lan on router three.  Figure three is an interactive activity that allows the learner to configure a fully qualified static route on router two to reach the router three lan. Figure four is an interactive activity that allows the learner to configure static routes on router three pointing to the networks on the other side of router two.
