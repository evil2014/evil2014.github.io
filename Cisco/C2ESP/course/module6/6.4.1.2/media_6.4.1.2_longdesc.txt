Figure one shows the binary representation of four remote networks. Figure two shows the binary representation of four remote networks, and the first fourteen bits are shaded in orange. These bits are the same in all four networks.  These networks will summarize to a slash fourteen. Figure three shows the binary representation of four remote networks, and the first fourteen bits are shaded in orange.  The remaining bits are all set to zero.  The first fourteen bits will translate into one seventy two dot twenty dot zero dot zero. Figure four shows two routers, each with a lan, connected to a single router which is connected to router one.  Router one has a callout that shows the syntax for configuring the summary route to the one seventy two dot twenty dot zero dot zero network.
