These figures are based on the standard lab diagram.  R. 1. with a lan connects to R. 2. with a lan which connects to R. 3. with a lan.  Figures one through three show the routing tables of each router.  Each router only lists the directly connected networks in the routing table. Figure four shows router one pinging the other end of the serial link to router two.  This ping is successful because these are directly connected routers. Figure five shows router one trying to ping the lan interface on router three.  This ping is unsuccessful since the routers are only aware of their directly connected networks.  Router one has no path to the lan on router three.
