These figures are based on four routers, and each router has a LAN attached.  Figure one shows that each lan has different host requirements.  Router one is connected to router two which is connected to router three which is connected to router four. Figure two shows a table with the fixed length subnetting for each of the four lans and remaining unused subnets.  This subnetting uses a class c address subnetted to a slash twenty-seven. Figure three shows how the last of the slash twenty-sevens is subnetted for the wan links. Figure four shows the interface configuration on router one. Figure five shows the interface configuration on router two. Figure six shows the interface configuration on router three. Figure seven shows the interface configuration on router four.
