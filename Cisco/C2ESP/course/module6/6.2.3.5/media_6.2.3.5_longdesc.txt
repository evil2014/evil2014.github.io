These figures show two routers connected with a serial cable.  Each router has a lan attached. Figure one shows the syntax for configuring a fully qualified static route on router one to the lan on router two.  The fully qualified route statement is required since we are using the link-local address as the next hop.  This requires the use of exit interface. Figure two shows the result of issuing the "show i. p. v. 6 route static pipe begin followed by an i. p. v. 6 address" command on router one. Figure three is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice configuring a fully qualified static route in i. p. v. 6.
