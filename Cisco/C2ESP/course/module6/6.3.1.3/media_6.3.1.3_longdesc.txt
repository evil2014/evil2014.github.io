These figures are based on the standard lab diagram. Figure one shows router one sending a routing update to router two.  This update sends the subnet instead of the classful network since the wan is in the same classful network as is included in the update. Figure two shows router two sending a routing update to router three.  This update sends the classful network instead of the subnet since the wan between router two and router three is in a different classful network.  When classful routing updates cross major network boundaries, they summarize to the major network.
