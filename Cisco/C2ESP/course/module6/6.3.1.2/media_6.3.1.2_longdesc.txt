Figure one shows a table that has the binary representation of the high order bits for Class A addresses, the decimal equivalent for the first octet, and the default subnet mask in dotted decimal. Figure two shows a table that has the binary representation of the high order bits for Class B addresses, the decimal equivalent for the first octet, and the default subnet mask in dotted decimal. Figure three shows a table that has the binary representation of the high order bits for Class C addresses, the decimal equivalent for the first octet, and the default subnet mask in dotted decimal.
