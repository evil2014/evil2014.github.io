These figures are based on the standard lab diagram.  Figure one shows the output of the "ping" command on router one to the P. C. on the router three lan.  This ping is using the source option to source the ping from the router one lan interface.  This ping fails. Figure two shows the output of the "trace route" command on router one to the p. c. on the router three lan.  The trace route fails since router two sends the packet back to router one.  The trace route shows the packet hopping back and forth from router one to router two. Figure three shows the output of the "show ip route" command on router two.  Here we notice that router two has a static route to the router three lan pointing to router one. Figure four shows the output of the "show running dash config" command on router two, listing the static routes.  We notice that the static route to the router three lan is misconfigured.  The output also shows removing the static route and replacing it with the properly configured route. Figure five shows the output of the "ping" command on router one to the P. C. on the router three lan.  This ping is using the source option to source the ping from the router one lan interface.  This ping is successful.
