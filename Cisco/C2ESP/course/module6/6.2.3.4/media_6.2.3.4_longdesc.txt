These figures are based on the standard lab diagram.  R. 1. with a lan connects to R. 2. with a lan which connects to R. 3. with a lan. Figure one shows configuring the static routes to remote networks on router one using i. p. v. 6.  The static routes were configured using exit interface. Figure two demonstrates the lookup process for router one to reach the lan on router three. Figure three is an interactive activity that allows the learner to configure a static route on router two, using i. p. v. 6, to reach the router three lan using exit interface. Figure four is an interactive activity that allows the learner to configure static routes on router three, using i. p. v. 6, pointing to the networks on the other side of router two.
