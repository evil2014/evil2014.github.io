These figures are based on the standard lab diagram.  Figure one shows the standard lab diagram.  Router one and two each have networks in the one seventy two dot sixteen dot zero dot zero classful network.  Router two and router three are connected with a one ninety two dot one sixty eight dot one dot zero.  Router three has a lan in the one ninety two dot one sixty eight dot two dot zero network. Figure two shows the output of the "show i. p. route static" command listing the static routes on router three pointing to the remote networks on routers one and two. Figure three shows the calculation of the summary route for the remote networks on routers one and two. Figure four shows the output from router three to remove the existing static routes and replace them with a summary route to the remote networks. Figure five shows the output of the "show i. p. route static" command listing the summary route previously created on router three.
