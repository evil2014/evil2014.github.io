These figures are based on the listing of the i. p. v. 6 routes on route one.  Figure one shows the four remote routes in i. p. v. 6 format with all leading zeros removed.  The portions of the address that are the same are shaded in orange.  The portions that are different are shaded in green. Figure two shows the four remote routes in i. p. v. 6 format in expanded form, with the missing zeros.  The portions of the address that are the same are shaded in orange.  The portions that are different are shaded in green. Figure three shows the four remote routes in i. p. v. 6 format in expanded form, with the missing zeros.  The portions of the address that are the same are shaded in orange.  The portions that are different are shaded in green and converted to binary. Figure four shows the bits that are the same shaded in orange.  There are sixty-one bits shaded orange.  Figure five shows the remaining bits are set to zero to create a summary route. Figure six shows the address converted back to hex. Figure seven shows the address in hex along with the prefix from step four.
