Figure one shows a table demonstrating how the ten dot zero dot zero dot zero slash eight network is subnetted into slash sixteens.  Figure two shows how the second slash sixteen subnet of the ten network can be further subnetted into slash twenty-fours. Figure three shows how the third slash sixteen subnet of the ten network can be further subnetted into slash twenty-fours. Figure four shows how the fourth slash sixteen subnet of the ten network can be further subnetted into slash twenty-eights. Figure five shows how the fifth slash sixteen subnet of the ten network can be further subnetted into slash twenties.
