Figure one shows four routers, and each have a LAN attached.  Each lan has different host requirements listed. Figure two shows the binary representation of each network, including the lans and wans.  The classful network bits are shaded in green, the subnet bits are shaded in purple, and the host bits are shaded in orange. Figure three shows the binary representation of the WAN links, which shows that the wan links are wasting 28 addresses when using fixed length subnet mask.
