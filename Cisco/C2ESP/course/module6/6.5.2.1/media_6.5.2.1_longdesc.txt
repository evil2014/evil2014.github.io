These figures are based on the standard lab diagram.  Figure one shows the output of the "ping" command on router one to the P. C. on the router three lan.  This ping is using the source option to source the ping from the router one lan interface. Figure two shows the output of the "trace route" command on router one to the P. C. on the router three lan. Figure three shows the output of the "show i. p. route" command on router one, displaying the routing table. Figure four shows the output of the "show i. p. interface brief" command on router one indicating that the lan and wan interface are both up. Figure five shows the output of the "show c. d. p. neighbors" command on router one listing router two as a neighbor along with the lan switch attached to router one.
