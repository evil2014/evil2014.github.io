These figures are based on the standard lab diagram with an additional link between router one and router three. Figure one shows the output of the "trace route" command on router one to the lan on router three taking two hops. Figure two shows serial zero zero zero and serial zero zero one on router two being shut down.  This should cause the floating static route to become the preferred route on router one.  Figure three shows the output of the "show i. p. route static" command on router one confirming that the floating static route has become the preferred route. Figure four shows the output of the "trace route" command on router one to the lan on router three taking one hop.
