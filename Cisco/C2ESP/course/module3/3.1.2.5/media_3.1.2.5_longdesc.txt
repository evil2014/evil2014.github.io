Figure one shows a switch connected to a v. o .i. p. phone, and a computer connected to the phone.  There are callouts indicating that the switch is configured to support voice traffic as well as traffic for v. lan twenty.  If the traffic is intended for the phone and is for v. lan one hundred fifty, it is directed to the phone.  However, if it is not destined for the phone, it is redirected to the computer. Figure two shows the output from the "show interface f. zero slash zero switchport" command on a switch.  The access v. lan and the voice v. lan are highlighted.
