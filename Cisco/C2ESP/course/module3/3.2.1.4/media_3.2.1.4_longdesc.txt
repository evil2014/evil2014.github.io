Figure one shows a table with the Cisco i. o. s. commands for removing a switchport from a v. lan. Figure two shows the syntax for removing port f. zero slash eighteen from a v. lan and the output of the "show v. lan brief" command to verify that port f. zero slash eighteen is back in v. lan one. Figure three shows the output from the "show interfaces f. a. zero slash eighteen" command. Figure four shows the syntax for configuring f. zero slash eleven as an access port and a member of v. lan twenty.  Also shown, is the output from the "show v. lan brief" command to verify that the port is assigned to the correct v. lan. Figure five is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice working with a switchport and assigning it and unassigning it to a v. lan.
