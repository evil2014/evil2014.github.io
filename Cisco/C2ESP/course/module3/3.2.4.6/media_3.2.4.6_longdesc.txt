Figure one shows a lan with two computers connected to switch three, an email server connected to switch one, and a web server connected to switch one.  One of the computers on switch three has a callout stating that it cannot connect to the e. mail server.  It is in a different v. lan, but has an i. p. address in the same subnet as the e. mail server. Figure two shows the output from the "show interfaces trunk" command on switches one and three.  The allowed v. lans on f. zero slash three are highlighted and switch one is missing v. lan twenty. Figure three shows the syntax for adding v. lan twenty to port f. zero slash three on switch one and the output from the "show interfaces trunk" command on switch one.  The output of a successful ping from p. c. five is also displayed.
