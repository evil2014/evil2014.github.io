Figure one shows a switch with a server and two computers connected.  The computers are connected to protected ports and the server is connected to an unprotected port.  There is a note that data traffic is not permitted between the two computers, but is allowed between the server and the computers. Figure two shows the syntax for configuring a switchport as a protected port. Figure three is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice configuring a port as a protected port.
