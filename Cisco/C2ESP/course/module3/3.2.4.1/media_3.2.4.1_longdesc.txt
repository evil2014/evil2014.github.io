Figure one shows a small lan with a p. c. connected to switch two, a p. c. connected to switch three, and a web server connected to switch one.  The links between the switches are trunk links and the necessary v. lans are allowed.  The p. c. connected to switch two has a callout stating that it cannot connect to the web server. Figure two shows the output from the "i. p. config" command on the p. c. Figure three shows a screenshot for configuring the i. p. address on the p. c. to change it to the correct subnet.  Note that the screenshot is from a p. c. in packet tracer.  Below is the output from a ping command on the p. c. showing a successful ping to the web server.
