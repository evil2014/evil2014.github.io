The p. c. has a callout stating that it cannot connect to the web server. Figure two shows the output from the "show interfaces trunk" command on switch one and the show interface f. zero slash three switchport" command on switch one. The mode of f. zero slash three is highlighted and set to dynamic auto.  The output from the "show interfaces trunk" command on switch three is also shown.  There are no trunks on switch three.  The output from the "show interfaces f. zero slash three" command on switch three is also displayed.
