Figure one shows switch one connected to switches two and three with trunk links.  There are callouts pointing to each of the switchports stating the mode they are configured as.  The two ports for the link between switches one and two are configured as trunk ports.  The ports for the link between switches one and three are configured as dynamic auto ports. Figure two shows the same lan. The link between switches one and two will form a trunk since both ports are set to trunk.  The link between switches one and three will not form a trunk since they are both set to dynamic auto.
