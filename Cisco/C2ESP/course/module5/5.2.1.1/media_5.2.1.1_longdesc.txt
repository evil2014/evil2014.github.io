Figure one shows a legacy inter-v.lan routing topology indicating two v.lans with the physical links leading to the router as default v.lans. Figure two shows a router-on-a-stick inter-v.lan routing topology indicating two v.lans and a single physical link leading to a router as a default v.lan. Figure three shows a router-on-a-stick inter-v.lan routing topology indicating a second switch being added but with an inoperative trunk link between the two switches.
