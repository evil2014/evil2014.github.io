Figure demonstrates two scenarios. One scenario indicates two hosts belonging to two different V.lans and each v.lan requiring a router in order to allow them to communicate with each other. The second scenario demonstrates that a layer 3 switch has been used in place of the router and that two switched virtual interfaces have been created to permit inter-v.lan routing.
