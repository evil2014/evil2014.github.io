Figure is an animation with a topology demonstrating three hosts connected to a three-switch cluster. Each switch is connected to each other through trunk links and one switch is connected to a router using a single physical cable. The animation demonstrates how a unicast packet travels through the topology and requires the router to be able to forward packets to different subnets. Highlighted is the single trunk link between the switch and the router, which is able to tag traffic and use router sub interfaces in order to route inter-subnet traffic.
