Figure is an animation that demonstrates the process of inter v.lan routing using the router-on-a-stick routing behavior. The process includes arp discovery to learn of the connected devices and the propagation of a unicast frame through the infrastructure.  A statement indicates that the frames travelling from the switch to the router are tagged, thanks to the configuration of a trunk link from the switch to the router sub-interfaces.
