Figure one shows a router that has been configured with the wrong V.lan on sub interface G 0 slash 0 dot 10 in a router-on-a-stick topology. This would prevent hosts on V.lan ten from being able to send data to other V.lans on the network. Figure two shows the output of the command, show interface and the command, show run with the emphasis being on the encapsulation type and the v.lan assignment.
