Figure one shows a simple network topology with two hosts connected to two switches, which ultimately terminate at a connected router. There is a screen showing the output of the command, show sdm prefer. Figure two shows the various options available to the command, sdm prefer, and goes on to activating lan base routing using the command, sdm prefer lan base-routing. Figure three demonstrates the result of activating sdm lan base routing by using the, show sdm prefer command. Figure four demonstrates the process of configuring a multilayer switch with s.v.i. i.p. addresses and activating i.p. routing by using the i.p. routing command. Figure five shows the i.p. routing table after using the, show i.p. route command on an i.p. routing enabled multilayer switch. Figure six demonstrates the ability to create a static default route on a multilayer switch and then shows the static route contained within the i.p. routing table on the switch. Figure seven demonstrates how to create a static route on a multilayer switch and how it is displayed in the i.p. routing table. Figure eight demonstrates a successful ping originating from a windows host p.c. located on V.lan one and a destination of a host p.c. located on v.lan two. Figure nine is a syntax checker demonstrating the entire process of setting a multilayer switch with lan based routing, reloading the device, viewing the resulting changes, and then creating a static default route on the switch.
