Figure one shows that a sub interface on a router connected in a legacy inter-v.lan routing topology has been configured with an incorrect i.p. address. This prevents hosts on that v.lan from being properly routed to other v.lans. Figure two demonstrates a host that has been configured with an incorrect i.p. address. This would prevent the host from being able to communicate with the router on a different v.lan. Figure three shows a host that has been configured with an i.p. address of 172 dot 17 dot 10 dot 21 slash 16 on one v.lan and a host located on a different v.lan configured with an i.p. address of 172 dot 17 dot 30 dot 23 slash 24.
