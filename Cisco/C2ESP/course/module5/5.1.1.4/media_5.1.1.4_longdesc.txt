Figure is an animation with a topology demonstrating three hosts connected to a three-switch cluster. Each switch is connected to each other through trunk links. The animation demonstrates a unicast packet being sent by a host on one V.lan subnet and then being routed to another V.lan subnet through a multi-layer switch.
