Figure is an animation with a topology demonstrating three hosts connected to a three-switch cluster. Each switch is connected to each other through trunk links and one switch is connected to a router using two physical cables. The animation demonstrates how a unicast packet travels through the topology and requires the router to be able to forward packets to different subnets. Highlighted is the need for two cables connected to two physical interfaces on the router to make inter-subnet connectivity possible.
