Figure is an animation demonstrating the various steps involved with legacy inter-v.lan routing. The process includes arp discovery to discover the connected devices, unicast packet delivery, and tagging frames on the trunk links. A note is provided that states the packets going to the router are un-tagged because it is not a trunk link.
