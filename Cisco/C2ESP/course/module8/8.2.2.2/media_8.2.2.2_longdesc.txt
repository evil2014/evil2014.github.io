Figure one shows how to calculate a wildcard mask for a slash 24 network.  This method writes out four sets of 255. The I.P.v.4. subnet mask is listed below.  The subnet mask is then subtracted from the four sets of 255, which results in the wildcard mask.  The figure lists 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 255 minus 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot zero.  This results in zero dot zero dot zero dot 255 as the wildcard mask. Figure two shows how to calculate a wildcard mask for a slash 26 network.  The figure lists 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 255 minus 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 192.  This results in zero dot zero dot zero dot 63 as the wildcard mask.
