Figure one shows the C.L.I. commands necessary for adjusting the O.S.P.F. cost on an interface manually.  The figure begins in global configuration mode, and the first command is interface serial zero slash zero slash one.  The next command is, no bandwidth 64.  The next command is, i.p. O.S.P.F. cost 15,625.  The output is listed from the command, show interface serial zero slash zero slash one pipe include B.W. The bandwidth is 1,544 kilo b.p.s.  This is followed with the output from the command, show i.p. O.S.P.F. interface serial zero slash zero slash one pipe include cost. The cost is 15,625.Figure two is a table summarizing the C.L.I. commands of the two methods used in modifying the costs of the serial links in the O.S.P.F. reference topology.
