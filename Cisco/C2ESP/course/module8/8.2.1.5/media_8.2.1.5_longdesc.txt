Figure one shows the output from the command, show i.p. protocols. The line in the output that displays the router I.D. is highlighted. For this router, the I.D. is 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot 5.  Figure two shows the commands used to change the router I.D. and begins in global configuration mode.  The first command is, router O.S.P.F. 10.  This command configures O.S.P.F. on the router and sets the process to 10.  The next command is, router hyphen i.d. one dot one dot one dot one.  This command sets the router I.D.  The router displays the directive for the user to reload or use clear i.p. O.S.P.F. process command for this to take effect.  Figure three shows the command, clear i.p. O.S.P.F. process, being run from privilege exec mode.  This results in the router essentially rebooting the routing protocol.  The figure also highlights router output that shows current adjacencies changing state from full to down, and then changing states from load to full.  The new router I.D. of one dot one dot one dot one is displayed. Figure four is an interactive media element that allows the learner to modify the router I.D.
