Figure one shows three routers connected linearly. All three are in the same O.S.P.F. area. Figure two shows three O.S.P.F. areas, area 0, area 1, and area 51.  Area 1 and area 51 are each connected to area 0 as per the requirement of O.S.P.F. Figure three shows a network failing in area 51. The network failure causes a change to the network.  This change is only propagated to routers within area 51.
