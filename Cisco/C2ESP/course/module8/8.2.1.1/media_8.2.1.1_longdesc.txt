Figure shows three routers configured in a triangle. Each router is connected to the other two routers over serial WAN links.  Each router has a local LAN configured on each gigabit Ethernet interface.  One of the three routers has a loopback interface configured that is simulating a connection to the Internet.  All three routers are in O.S.P.F. area 0.  There are seven networks in the topology, and this topology will be referenced in the next few pages as the O.S.P.F. reference topology.
