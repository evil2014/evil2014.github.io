Figure is a top down chart transitioning through the O.S.P.F. states.  It begins with establishing neighbor adjacencies starting with the down state, moves to the init state, and transitions to the two way state.  Next is the synchronizing O.S.P.F. databases process.  This starts with the Ex-start state, moves to the exchange state, and ends with the loading state.  This moves the O.S.P.F. router to the full state.
