Figure one shows the output from the command show i.p.v.6. protocols. The router i.d. is 10 dot 1 dot 1 dot 1.Figure two shows the commands used when changing the router i.d. The first command is, i.p.v.6. router O.S.P.F. 10.  The i.d. is configured using the command, router hyphen i.d. 1 dot 1 dot 1 dot 1.Figure three shows the command used to clear the O.S.P.F. process so the newly configured i.d. can take effect. The command is, clear i.p.v.6. O.S.P.F. process.  The router responds with the following question, reset the selected O.S.P.F.v.3. processes?  The response from the user is either a y for yes or an n for no.  The figure enters y for yes.  The output from the command, show i.p.v.6. protocols, is displayed and the router i.d. is now listed as 1 dot 1 dot 1 dot 1.Figure four is an interactive media element that allows the learner to modify the router I.D. on router R-1.
