Figure one shows five routers. All five are connected to a central switch. No router is directly connected to another router.  The figure is demonstrating a multiaccess network that would require the formation of 10 adjacencies. Figure two is a chart that demonstrates how an increase in routers causes a drastic increase in adjacencies.  For example 5 routers will require 10 adjacencies, 20 routers will require 190 adjacencies, and 100 routers will require 4,950 adjacencies. Figure three shows five routers. All three are connected to a central switch. No router is directly connected to another router.  Figure is an animation that shows one of the routers sending out a link state advertisement to each of the other routers that it formed an adjacency with.  As each of these four routers receives the L.S.A., they will send out their own L.S.A.  This demonstrates a great deal of unnecessary network traffic. Figure four shows the same topology as figure three. However, now the network has one router elected as the designated router and one as the backup designated router.  The other routers send their L.S.A. only to these two routers.  The D.R. will then send out the L.S.A. to the other routers.  This greatly reduces network traffic.
