Figure one shows the C.L.I. commands used to configure a passive interface on a router running O.S.P.F.  The figure begins in global configuration mode and the first command is, router O.S.P.F. 10, where ten is an arbitrary process I.D. This command activates O.S.P.F. as the routing protocol.  The next command is, passive hyphen interface gigabit ethernet zero slash zero.  This command prevents the transmission of routing messages through the router interface. Figure two shows the output from the command, show i.p. protocols. The line that lists the passive interfaces are highlighted. Here, the gigabit ethernet zero slash zero interface is listed as passive. Figure three is an interactive media element that allows the learner to configure passive interfaces in O.S.P.F.
