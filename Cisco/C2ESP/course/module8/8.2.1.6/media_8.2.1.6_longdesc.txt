Figure one shows the commands used to configure a loopback interface on a router to serve as the router I.D.  The figure begins in global configuration mode.  The first command is, interface loopback zero, which moves to interface configuration.  The next command is, i.p. address one dot one dot one dot one 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot 255. This command sets the I.P. address.  This is now the router I.D.
