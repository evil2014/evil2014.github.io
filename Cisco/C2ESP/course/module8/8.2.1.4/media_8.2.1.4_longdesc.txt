Figure one displays the O.S.P.F. reference topology and has added router I.D. values.  Router R-1 has a router I.D. configured of one dot one dot one dot one.  Router R-2 has a router I.D. configured of two dot two dot two dot two.  Router R-3 has a router I.D. configured of three dot three dot three dot three.  Figure two shows the commands used to assign a router I.D.  The figure begins in global configuration mode.  The first command is, router O.S.P.F. 10.  This command configures O.S.P.F. on the router and sets the process to 10.  The next command is, router hyphen i.d. one dot one dot one dot one.  This command sets the router I.D.  The figure then shows the output from the command, show i.p. protocols. The line in the output that displays the router I.D. is highlighted. Figure three is an interactive media element that allows the learner to assign a router I.D. on a router.
