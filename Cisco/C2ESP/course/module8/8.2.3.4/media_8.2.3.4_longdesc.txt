Figure shows the O.S.P.F. reference topology and includes the serial link speeds. The link between router R-1 and router R-2 has a speed of 1,544 kilo b.p.s. The link between R-2 and R-3 is running at 1,024 kilo b.p.s. The link between R-1 and R-3 is running at 64 kilo b.p.s.  Figure two shows the output from the following command run on router R-1, show interfaces serial zero slash zero slash zero.  The figure highlights the line that lists the bandwidth at 1,544 kilo b.p.s.  Figure three shows the output from the following command run on router R-1, show interfaces serial zero slash zero slash one pipe include B.W.  The figure lists the bandwidth at 1,544 kilo b.p.s. Figure four shows the output from the following command run on router R-1, show i.p. O.S.P.F. interface serial zero slash zero slash one being.  The figure highlights the cost of the link is 647.
