Figure one shows the C.L.I. commands used to assign an interface to an O.S.P.F. area. The figure begins in global configuration mode. The first command is router O.S.P.F. 10 where ten is an arbitrary process I.D. This command activates O.S.P.F. as the routing protocol.  The next command is used to identify which interfaces will participate in O.S.P.F. It is based on the I.P. address and subnet mask.  In the figure the command is, network 172 dot 16 dot 1 dot zero zero dot zero dot zero dot 255 area zero.  This command activates O.S.P.F. on the interface that is on the specified network.  The next command is, network 172 dot 16 dot 1 dot zero zero dot zero dot zero dot 3 area zero.  The last command is, network 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot 4 zero dot zero dot zero dot 255 area zero.  Figure two shows the C.L.I. commands used to assign interfaces to an O.S.P.F. area with a quad zero.  The figure begins in global configuration mode, and the first command activates O.S.P.F. as the routing protocol. The command is, router O.S.P.F. 10, where ten is an arbitrary process I.D.  The next command is used to identify which interfaces will participate in O.S.P.F. It is based on the I.P. address and a quad zero wildcard mask.  In the figure the command is, network 172 dot 16 dot 1 dot 1 zero dot zero dot zero dot zero area zero.  The next command is, network 172 dot 16 dot 3 dot 1 zero dot zero dot zero dot zero area zero.  The last command is, network 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot 5 zero dot zero dot zero dot zero area zero.  Figure three is an interactive media element that allows the learner to advertise networks in O.S.P.F.
