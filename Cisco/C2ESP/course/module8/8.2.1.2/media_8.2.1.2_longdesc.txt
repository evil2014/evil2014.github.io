Figure one displays the O.S.P.F. reference topology as described in the previous page. Figure two shows the command that activates O.S.P.F. on a router.  The command is router O.S.P.F. 10, where 10 is the arbitrary and locally significant process I.D. Figure three is an interactive media element that allows the learner to enter O.S.P.F. configuration mode on a router.
