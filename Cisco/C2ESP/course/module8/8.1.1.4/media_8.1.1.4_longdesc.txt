Figure one shows 4 routers in a diamond pattern. Each router is directly connected to its two neighboring routers.  There is one router in the middle of the diamond pattern and it is connected to two of the other routers.  The figure is displaying Hello packets being sent and received by all neighboring routers. Figure two displays link state advertisements being sent and received by all routers. Figure three is highlighting one router beginning to build the topology table, which is currently empty. Figure four shows gears in a wheel representing that the router will use the shortest path first algorithm when building the topology table. Figure five shows a router branching off into multiple branches as in a family tree diagram.  This represents the S.P.F. tree. Figure six list the contents of the S.P.F. tree in a table.  The list contains all of the destination networks, the shortest path to reach those networks, and the total cost of each path.
