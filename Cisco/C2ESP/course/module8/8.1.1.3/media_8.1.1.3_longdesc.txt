Figure one is a table listing the O.S.P.F. data structures.  O.S.P.F. creates an adjacency database, which holds the neighbor table and will list all neighbor routers.  The command, show i.p. O.S.P.F. neighbor, is used to view the table.  O.S.P.F. creates a link-state database, which holds the topology table and lists information about all other routers in the network.  The command, show i.p. O.S.P.F. database, is used to view this table.  O.S.P.F. also creates a forwarding database which holds the routing table.  This will list the routes generated when an algorithm is run on the link state database.  The command, show i.p. route, is used to view this table. Figure two lists the packets that O.S.P.F. routers exchange.
