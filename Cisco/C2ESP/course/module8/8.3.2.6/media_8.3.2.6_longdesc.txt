Figure one shows the O.S.P.F. reference topology. Figure two shows the commands needed to enable O.S.P.F.v.3. on the interfaces of router R-1.  The figure begins in global configuration mode. The first command is, interface gigabit ethernet zero slash zero.  This is followed by the command i.p.v.6. O.S.P.F. 10 area zero.  The figure then moves to the serial zero slash zero slash zero interface and repeats the command, i.p.v.6. O.S.P.F. 10 area zero.  The figure then moves to the serial zero slash zero slash one interface and repeats the command, i.p.v.6. O.S.P.F. 10 area zero.  The output from the command, shows i.p.v.6. O.S.P.F. interfaces brief, is displayed. The output shows that the three interfaces are all in area zero and are participating in O.S.P.F. version 3.Figure three is an interactive media element that allows the learner to enable O.S.P.F. version 3 on the interfaces on router R-2.
