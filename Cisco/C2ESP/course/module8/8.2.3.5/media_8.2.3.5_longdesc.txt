Figure shows the C.L.I. commands required to adjust the bandwidth on an interface.  The figure begins in global configuration mode, and the first command is, interface serial zero slash zero slash one.  The next command is, bandwidth 64.  The figure then lists the output from the command, show interfaces serial zero slash zero slash one pipe include B.W. The output lists the bandwidth as 64 kilo b.p.s.  The output is shown from the command, show i.p. O.S.P.F. interface serial zero slash zero slash one pipe include cost.  The cost of the link is 15,625.Figure two is an interactive media element that allows the learner to adjust interface bandwidths.
