Figure one shows a table of costs after running the command, auto hyphen cost reference hyphen bandwidth 1,000.  In the table, each calculation is using 1 gigabit for the reference bandwidth. The result lists a cost of 10 for 100 mega b.p.s. and a cost of 1 for gigabit and ten gigabit Ethernet.  Figure two shows a table of costs after running the command, auto hyphen cost reference hyphen bandwidth 10,000.  In the table, each calculation is using 10 gigabit for the reference bandwidth. The result lists a cost of 100 for 100 mega b.p.s., a cost of 10 for gigabit Ethernet, and a cost of 1 for ten gigabit Ethernet. Figure three shows the O.S.P.F. reference topology, and lists the serial link costs after running the command, auto-cost reference-bandwidth 1000.  This command results in the cost of the link between routers R-1 and R-2 to change from 64 to 647.Figure four shows the output from the command, show i.p. O.S.P.F. interface serial zero slash zero slash zero.  The figure highlights the cost being listed as 647 for the link. Figure five shows the output of the command, show i.p. route pipe include 12 dot 16 dot 2 dot zero. The metric of the route is listed as 648 and is highlighted.
