Figure one shows the O.S.P.F. reference topology. Three routers are configured in a triangle. Each router is connected to the other two routers over serial WAN links.  The link between router R-1 and router R-2 has a speed of 1,544 kilo b.p.s., the link between R-2 and R-3 is running at 1,024 kilo b.p.s., and the link between R-1 and R-3 is running at 64 kilo b.p.s.  Each router has a local LAN configured on the gigabit Ethernet zero slash zero interface.  One of the three routers has a loopback interface configured that is simulating a connection to the Internet.  All three routers are in O.S.P.F. area 0.Figure two shows the output from the command, show i.p. route pipe include 172 dot 16 dot 2 dot zero.  The figure highlights the metric to reach the network and that value is 65.  The figure then lists the output from the command, show I.p. route 172 dot 16 dot 2 dot zero. The section in the output that states “route metric is 65” is highlighted.
