Figure one shows two routers connected through a gigabit Ethernet link on the 172 dot 16 dot 5 dot 0 slash 24 network.  Router R-1 has the I.P. address of 172 dot 16 dot 5 dot 1 slash 24 and router R-2 has the I.P. address of 172 dot 16 dot 5 dot 2 slash 24. The second address is the higher router I.D. and therefore becomes the master for the Exchange State. Figure two shows the two routers exchanging D.B.D. packets.  Figure three shows the two routers exchanging L.S.R. packets, L.S.U. packets, and L.S. Ack packets.
