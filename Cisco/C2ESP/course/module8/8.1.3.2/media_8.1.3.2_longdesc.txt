Figure one shows two routers connected through a gigabit Ethernet link.  The gigabit Ethernet interface on router R-1 is 172 dot 16 dot 5 dot 1 slash 24 and the gigabit Ethernet interface on router R-2 is 172 dot 16 dot 5 dot 2. The figure shows R-1 starting in the down state and then moving to the init state.  In this state the O.S.P.F. router sends out Hello packets to the multicast address of 224 dot zero dot zero dot 5.Figure two shows R-2 receiving the Hello packet and returning a unicast Hello packet containing its router I.D. and list of neighboring routers. Figure three shows R-1 receiving the Hello packet from R-2 and moving to the two way state. Figure four shows the two routers agreeing on the second router becoming the designated router and the first router becoming the backup designated router based on the router I.D.s.
