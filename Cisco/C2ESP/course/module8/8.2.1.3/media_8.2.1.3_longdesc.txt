Figure is a flow chart that details the router I.D. order of precedence.  The first question asks if the router I.D. is explicitly configured.  If the answer is yes, then that is the router I.D.  If the answer is no, the next question is whether a loopback interface is configured?  If the answer is yes, then that is the router I.D.  If the answer is no, then that router I.D. is the highest active configured I.P. address.
