Figure one is a flow chart the details the router I.D. order of precedence.  The first question asks if the router I.D. is explicitly configured.  If the answer is yes, then that is the router I.D.  If the answer is no, then the next question is whether a loopback interface is configured?  If the answer is yes, then the highest configured address is the router I.D.  If the answer is no, then that router I.D. is the highest active configured I.P. address.  If the answer to all three questions is no, then the router will display an error message stating that O.S.P.F. version three could not pick a router I.D. and that it needs to be configured manually. Figure two shows the O.S.P.F. reference topology and lists the router i.d. for each router.  R-1 has a configured i.d. of one dot one dot one dot one.  R-2 has a configured i.d. of two dot two dot two dot two. R-3 has a configured i.d. of three dot three dot three dot three. Figure three shows the commands necessary to configure router R-1.  The figure begins in global configuration mode. The first command is, i.p.v.6. router O.S.P.F. 10, where 10 is an arbitrary process i.d. This command activates the O.S.P.F. version 3 routing protocol.  The prompt returned by the router is, R.1. open parentheses config hyphen r.t.r. close parentheses.  The next command is, router hyphen i.d. 1 dot 1 dot 1 dot 1.  This is followed by the configuration of the reference bandwidth, and the command is, auto hyphen cost reference hyphen bandwidth 1,000.  The figure then shows the output from the command, show i.p.v.6. protocols, which verifies the router i.d. Figure four is an interactive media element that allows the learner to assign the router i.d. to R-2.
