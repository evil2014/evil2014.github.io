Figure one is an animation showing that a switch configured for store-and-forward frame processing will receive an entire frame from a source. First, the switch will compute the C.R.C. to ensure that the frame was not corrupted. The switch will look up the destination address and then forward the frame to the destination. Figure two is an animation showing that a switch configured for cut-through frame processing will forward the frame immediately after receiving and processing the destination address.
