Figure one shows three p.c.s. Each p.c. is connected to one switch. A frame is being sent from one p.c. into the switch. Figure two shows three p.c.s. Each p.c. is connected to one switch. A frame is being sent from p.c. 1 into the switch. Text in the figure states that the switch M.A.C. table has created a new entry indicating Port 1 has learned the M.A.C. address of P.C. 1, and all other ports are empty. Figure three shows a switch forwarding a frame out ports 2 and 3 to p.c. 3 and p.c. 2. The switch does not know the mac addresses for p.c. 3 and p.c. 2.Figure four shows P.C. 3 responding by sending a frame to the switch. Figure five shows that a switch has processed a frame it received from P.C. 3. The mac address tab now contains the mac address for p.c. 3.Figure six shows a frame being returned to P.C. 1 from the switch.
