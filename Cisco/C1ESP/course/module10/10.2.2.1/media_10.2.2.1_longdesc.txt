Figure one shows a client computer and a server connected to a network.  The client is attempting to reach cisco dot com using a web browser.  The client makes a D.N.S. query to a D.N.S. server. Figure two shows an N.S. record matching w.w.w. dot cisco dot com to an I.P. address. Figure three shows the client sending the D.N.S. request to the server. Figure four shows the D.N.S. server responding to the D.N.S. query with the I.P. address for w.w.w. dot cisco dot com. Figure five shows the client now has the I.P. address to put in the layer 3 header as the destination I.P. for the H.T.T.P. request.
