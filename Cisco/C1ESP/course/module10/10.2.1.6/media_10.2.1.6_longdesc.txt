The figure shows the interaction between all devices involved with an e mail transmission.  The sender (M.U.A.) sends the message to the M.T.A,. the MTA forwards the message to another M.T.A., which will deliver the message to the recipient.  Since this M.T.A. has the address of the recipient, it acts as a Mail Delivery Agent (M.D.A.).  The message is then sent to the recipient (M.U.A.) using P.O.P. 3.
