The figure shows the D.N.S. hierarchy.  A client communicates with a local D.N.S. server.  That server can communicate with Top-level domain servers for records it does not have in its D.N.S. database.  The Top-Level servers can communicate with the Root servers for any records they do not have.  The Root servers have All D.N.S. records.
