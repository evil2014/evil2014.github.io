Figure shows an enlarged diagram of U.T.P. cable.  There are call outs for the outer jacket, which protects the wires, one for the twisted pair, which protects against cross-talk, and another for the twisted pairs showing that they are coated with plastic insulation.  The individual wires are color coded.
