Figure shows three computers connected to the same media.  Each has a call out.  One says "I have nothing to send", the second says "It is my turn to send.  I will send now" and the third says "I have a packet to send, but it is not my turn.  I'll wait".  There is a table below that displays the characteristics of controlled access technologies.  This figure demonstrates Controlled Access as opposed to contention based access to the line.
