Figure one shows two computers connected with an Ethernet cable. Figure two is a video that shows a switch and server connected.  This video demonstrates half duplex connections where data can only flow in one direction at a time. Figure three is a video that shows a switch and server connected.  This video demonstrates full duplex connections where data can flow in both directions at the same time.
