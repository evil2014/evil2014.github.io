This animation demonstrates how computers send frames on a multi-access topology.  There are five computers connected to the media.  Host A wants to send a frame so it listens for transmissions and determines that the line is available so it sends.  The frame travels to Host E.  After Host A sends, Host B wants to send to Host D.  When Host B listens for transmissions, it notices that there is a transmission on the line and waits until it is completed.
