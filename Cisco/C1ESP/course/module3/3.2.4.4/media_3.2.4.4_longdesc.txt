Figure lines up the two models and shows the correlation between layers.  The application, presentation and session layers of the O.S.I. model line up with the Application layer of T.C.P.I.P. model.  The Transport layers align together.  The O.S.I. network layer aligns with the Internet layer of T.C.P.I.P. and the O.S.I. data link and physical align with the T.C.P.I.P. network access layer.
