Figure shows a computer communicating with a device on a remote network.  PC 1 has an I.P. address of 192 dot 168 dot 1 dot 110, and a MAC address of A A dash A A dash A A dash A A dash A A dash A A.  It is sending data to a remote web server at I.P. address 172 dot 16 dot 1 dot 99 and a MAC address of A B dash C D dash E F dash 1 2 dash 3 4 dash 5 6.  The server is on a remote network so PC 1 has to send the data to the router to be sent across the network.  When PC 1 forms the data frame the source I.P. and source MAC address are from PC 1.  The destination I.P. is that of the server, but the destination MAC is that of the router, which is the default gateway.  So in the figure that address is 1 1 dash 1 1 dash 1 1 dash 1 1 dash 1 1 dash 1 1 dash.  The point here is that the switch needs to send the data to the router to be routed, and it only knows the router by MAC address.
