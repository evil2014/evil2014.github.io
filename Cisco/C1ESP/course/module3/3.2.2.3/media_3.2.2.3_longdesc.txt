Figure one is an interactive media element that allows the user to select one of the many T.C.P.I.P protocols and receive a brief description about it.  The protocols include D.N.S., D.H.C.P., S.M.T.P., F.T.P., U.D.P., T.C.P., I.P., and A.R.P. Figure two is an animation that shows the protocol encapsulation process involved when a web server sends a web page to a client across a network. Figure three is an animation that shows the protocol de-encapsulation process involved when a web client receives a web page from a web server across a network.
