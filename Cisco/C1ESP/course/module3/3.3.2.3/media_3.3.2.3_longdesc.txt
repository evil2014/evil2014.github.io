Figure is an animation showing the ARP process that occurs on a local area network.  The sending computer is PC1 and it is sending data to an F.T.P. server.  The computer knows the I.P. address of the server, which is 192 dot 168 dot 1 dot nine.  However it does not have the serverâ€™s MAC address in its ARP cache, so it will send out an ARP request.  This ARP request will ask for the device with a specified I.P. address to respond with its MAC address.  The ARP request is sent to the switch which will broadcast it out all ports.  The device with the specified I.P. address will respond to the initiating device with its MAC address.
