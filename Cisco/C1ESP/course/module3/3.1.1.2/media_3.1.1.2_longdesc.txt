Figure one has two sentences used to represent the importance of establishing rules for communication.  The first sentence is a long sentence that does not have any spaces between the words, which makes it difficult to read.  A second sentence is written in Spanish, and could be hard to understand if the receiver doesnâ€™t speak the language.  There is a Translate button that the learner can select that will add the spaces between the words and also translate form Spanish to English. Figure two is a star diagram that has Protocols as the central word and the branches are characteristics of protocols.  These characteristics include message encoding, message formatting and encapsulation, message size, message timing and message delivery options.
