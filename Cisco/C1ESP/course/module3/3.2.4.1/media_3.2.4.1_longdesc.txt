Figure shows the two competing networking models side by side, the seven layer O.S.I. model and the four layer T.C.P.I.P. model.  The main T.C.P.I.P. suite protocols are listed for each of the layers.  The application, presentation and session layers of the O.S.I. model line up with the Application layer of T.C.P.I.P. model, and here are H.T.T.P., D.N.S., D.H.C.P., and F.T.P.  The Transport layers align together and carry T.C.P. and U.D.P.  The O.S.I. network layer aligns with the Internet layer of T.C.P.I.P. and carries both I.P. version 4 and version 6 along with I.C.M.P. for both versions 4 and 6.  The O.S.I. data link and physical align with the T.C.P.I.P. network access layer and some of the protocols here are PPP, Frame Relay and Ethernet.
