Figure is an animation of protocol operations sending a message.  In the animation a web page is being sent from a web server to a web client.  The data is passed from the application layer down to the transport layer where the data is encapsulated by the transport layer information, and here it is using T.C.P.  The segment is then passed to the Internet layer where it gets the I.P. addressing information.  The encapsulation continues as the packet is then passed to the data link layer where it is encapsulated within a frame header and trailer.  The bits are encoded onto the media by the server network interface card.
