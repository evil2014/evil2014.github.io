Figure one is an animation of the communication process between two people, specifically on the message size.   A woman is thinking of a message, she formulates the message and transmits it to a man very quickly with no spacing between the words.  The man cannot process the information in this manner and has to ask for it to be re-sent in a slower and organized fashion.  The woman complies and this time the man can understand the information.  This represents segmenting of data. Figure two is an animation of the communication process between two computers.   The data is sent from one computer to another very quickly and with no breaks, which the receiving computer cannot process.   The sending computer repeats sending data and the second time it segments the message, which can then be processed by the receiving computer.
