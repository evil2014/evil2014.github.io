Figure is an animation of protocol operations receiving a message.  In this figure the data is taken apart in the reverse order that it was encapsulated in.  The receiving computer removes the layer two header and trailer and checks the frame addressing.  The computer determines that it needs to read the data so it removes the I.P. address and reads the segment information.  The computer removes the segment header and then processes the data, which for a web client means displaying the web page.
