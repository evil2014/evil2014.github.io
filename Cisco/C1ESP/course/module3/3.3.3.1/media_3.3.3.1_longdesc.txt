Figure shows the process of a computer on a local network using its default gateway to send a message to a destination outside of the local network.  In the network there are two computers and one F.T.P. server all on the same segment.  They all have the same I.P. address for a default gateway, which is 192 dot 168 dot 1 dot 1, and this device is the closest router port to each of the devices.
