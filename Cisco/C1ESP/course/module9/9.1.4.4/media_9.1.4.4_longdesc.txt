Figure one shows the 16 subnets that are formed when creating slash twenty sixes out of a slash twenty two.  You can see that by alternating bits 23, 24, 25, and 26 in a logical order, you can easily determine the network I.D.s for all sixteen subnets. Figure two has a callout pointing to the 4 subnet bits, which demonstrates how 16 subnets are formed. There is also a callout pointing to the 6 remaining host bits showing that there are 62 valid hosts on each of these subnets. Figure three shows how these subnets might be assigned to the departments in a corporate network.  Each subnet is the same size.
