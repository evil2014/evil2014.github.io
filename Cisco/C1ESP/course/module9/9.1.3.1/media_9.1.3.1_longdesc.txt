Figure one shows how an I.P. version 4 address is separated into network portion and host portion.  Figure two shows how we can borrow bits from the host portion to make subnets.  This figure is borrowing 1 bit and as a result can make 2 subnets.  With one bit there are 2 values.  The bit can be a zero or a one. Figure three shows the network I.D. and broadcast address for each of the two subnets.
