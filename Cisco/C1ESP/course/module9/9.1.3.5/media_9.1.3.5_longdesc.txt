Figure one shows two routers connected with a serial link, each with two LANs. Figure two shows the network I.D., first valid host address, last valid host address, and broadcast address for the first four subnets after borrowing three host bits for subnetting. Figure three shows the network I.D., first valid host address, last valid host address, and broadcast address for the last four subnets after borrowing three host bits for subnetting. Figure four shows two routers connected with a serial link, each with two LAN's with the network I.D.'s assigned to corresponding networks. Figure five shows the C.L.I. output from two routers with the configuration from all six interfaces including the I.P. address and subnet mask.
