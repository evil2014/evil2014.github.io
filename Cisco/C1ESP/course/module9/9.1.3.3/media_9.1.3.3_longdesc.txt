Figure one shows an I.P. address with the first three octets in decimal.  The fourth octet is in binary with the first bit highlighted in red indicating that it was borrowed for subnetting.  This allows us to make 2 (2 raised to the first power) subnets.  Figure two shows an I.P. address with the first three octets in decimal.  The fourth octet is in binary with the last 7 bits for host addressing.  This allows us to make 126 (2 raised to the seventh power minus 2) host addresses.
