Figure one shows that given a 10 dot 0 dot 0 dot 0 slash 8 network, if you borrow ten host bits for subnetting, you can create two raised to the tenth power (or 1024) subnets. Figure two shows that if you borrow ten bits for subnetting from a slash 8, you have eighteen network bits and therefore 14 host bits.  With 14 host bits, you have two raised to the fourteenth power minus two (or 16,382) valid hosts on each subnet. Figure three shows the network I.D., first valid host, last valid host, and subnet mask for the first slash 18 in the 10 dot 0 dot 0 dot 0 network.
