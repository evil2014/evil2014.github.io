Figure one shows an I.P. address with the first three octets in decimal.  The fourth octet is in binary with the first two bits highlighted in red indicating that they were borrowed for subnetting.  The four subnets are the 192 dot 168 dot 1 dot 0 slash 26, the 192 dot 168 dot 1 dot 64 slash 26, the 192 dot 168 dot 1 dot 128 slash 26 and the 192 dot 168 dot 1 dot 192 slash 26. Figure two shows how to calculate the number of hosts on each subnet.  Since there are six bits left for hosts, there are 62 (two raised to the sixth minus two) valid hosts on each subnet. Figure three shows the network ID, first valid host address, last valid host address and the broadcast address for the first subnet. Figure four shows the network ID, first valid host address, last valid host address, and the broadcast address for the first three subnets. Figure five shows a router with 2 LANs and one WAN connected.  The C.L.I. is also shown with each interface configured with the appropriate interface address from one of the subnets.
