Figure one shows the structure of an I.P. version 6 address.  The first 48 bits are for Global Routing Prefix, the next 16 bits are for Subnet I.D., and the last 64 bits are for the interface I.D. Figure two shows that the 16 bits, represented in hexadecimal, can make 65,536 subnets.  These subnets are 0 0 0 0 through F F F F.
