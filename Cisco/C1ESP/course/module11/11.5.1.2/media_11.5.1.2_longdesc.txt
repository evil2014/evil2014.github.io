Figure shows a close-up view of both the front and the back of the Linksys integrated router model W.R.T. 300 N-2.  This device is a simplified, low-cost device that carries out the functionality of multiple network devices, such as a switch, a router, and a wireless access point.  On the front it has light emitting diodes, which indicate the connection status of each port.  There is an L.E.D. for power, Internet connection, wireless connection, and one for each of four switch ports on the device.  On the back, there are five ports, first is a single port that is connected to the router portion of the multifunction device. This is used to connect the device to another network, such as the Internet. The router portion of a multifunction device maintains routing tables. There is an internal connection from the routing portion of the multifunction device to the switch portion. The Internet port is connected to a different network than the Ethernet ports. Next, are four ports that are connected to the internal switch portion of the multifunction device. These are usually labeled "Ethernet".  All devices connected to the switch ports are on the same local network. There is also an internal connection from the switch port to the router port.
