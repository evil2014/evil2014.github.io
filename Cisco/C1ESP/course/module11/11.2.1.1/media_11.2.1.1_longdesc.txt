The figure is an interactive activity that shows four pictures.  One picture is of a folder with a caption of Information Theft. One picture is of a hammer and a hard drive with a caption of Data Loss and Manipulation. One picture is of a check register and credit card with a caption of Identity Theft. One picture is of a computer with a bug on the screen and a 4.0.4. error "Page not found".  These pictures are all focused on network security.  When you click each of the pictures, a callout displays a description of the caption along with information and examples.
