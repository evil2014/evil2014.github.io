Figure one is an example of a password attack.  The user authentication dialog box is shown. Figure two is a video showing how a trust exploitation works.  An attacker on a host cannot get access to system A, but can get access to system B.  Since system B can access system A, the attacker can now access system A. Figure three shows a complex network.  There is an attacker on a host.  The attacker cannot access a device on the inside of a firewall.  However, the attacker can access a host that can access devices inside the firewall.  This is a form of a trust exploitation using port redirection.  Now packets can be forwarded to the trusted host to be redirected into the network. Figure four is an example of a man in the middle attack.  There is a laptop connected to a switch. The switch connects to a router and then to the Internet.  The attacker convinces the laptop to forward all traffic to his computer.  The attacker forwards the traffic correctly and returns it to the laptop. However, as a result, the attacker can inspect all packets to and from the laptop.
