Figure one shows three houses, and each are using wireless communications inside the home.  There is a car parked on the street in front of the three homes. Inside the car is a person using a laptop computer.  This figure is used to show security concerns of wireless technology and lists some steps that should be implemented to mitigate such threats.  The first steps include changing all default values, disabling the S.S.I.D. broadcast, and enabling encryption.  Wardriving is the process of driving around an area searching for wireless LANs. Once discovered, the location of the WLAN is logged and shared. The goal of wardriving is to bring attention to the fact that most wireless networks are insecure and to show the widespread acceptance and use of wireless LAN technology.  A similar process to wardriving is known as warwalking or warchaulking where the person walks around an area to discover wireless access. Once access is discovered a chalk mark is placed in front of the location to indicate the status of the wireless connection. Figure two is an animation showing the encryption process between a wireless access point and a wireless client.  The access point requests the pre-configured and pre-shared key from the client before allowing access.
