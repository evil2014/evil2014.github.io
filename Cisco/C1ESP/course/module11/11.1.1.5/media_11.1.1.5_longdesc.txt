The figure shows a tall router that has been sectioned into different types of traffic.  At the bottom of the router is F.T.P. traffic, then above that is Instant Messaging, then S.M.T.P., and finally at the top is Voice.  This figure is demonstrating how routers can prioritize traffic before sending to the backbone.
