Figure one shows a complex network.  There is a call out from Router A demonstrating a trace route from a router using the command "trace route".  There is also a callout from Host 1 demonstrating a trace route from a P.C. using the command "tracert", spelled t.r.a.c.e.r.t. Figure two shows a picture of hyper terminal with the Capture Text feature being used to make a copy of the output from the trace route test.
