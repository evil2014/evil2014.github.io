Figure one shows a single computer that has multiple web pages open along with an instant messaging window, an e-mail application, a streaming video application and a V.O.I.P phone application running.  This represents that a computer typically has more than one process running any one time and it is the transport layer that tracks each individual conversation flowing between a source application and a destination application separately. Figure two shows a series of data blocks being transmitted to the computer.  The data blocks are of varying colors which correspond to different services. Figure three shows the computer sending the packages to the proper application, the web browser, the e-mail client, the streaming video application or the V.O.I.P. phone.  Each application has a specific data block color.  This represents the computer sorting the data based on application. Figure four shows the setup and termination of a data transfer session between a host and a server.
