Figure one shows a server running a D.N.S. server on port 53 and a RADIUS server on port 1812.  The figure has two clients accessing the server.  Client 1 is sending a D.N.S. request from source port 49152 to destination port 53.  Client 2 is sending a RADIUS request from source port 51152 to destination port 1812.  This demonstrates how port numbers are used to differentiate between multiple services running on one server. Figure two highlights the use of the well-known ports for the services. Figure three highlights the use of random port numbers as the source ports. Figure four highlights the response from the server to each of the two requests and the fact that the server uses the source port from the request packet as the destination. Figure five highlights the new destination port.
