Figure shows the acknowledgement of T.C.P. packets process.  One computer is sending data to another through a WAN link.  In the figure, the sending computer sets the sequence number to 1, sets the acknowledgement number to 1, and then sends 10 bytes of data.  The receiving computer indicates that it received 10 bytes of data by sending an acknowledgement back to the sending computer that has the sequence set to 1 and the acknowledgement number set to 11.  The sending computer recognizes that the 10 bytes have been received so it begins to transmit more data starting with a sequence number of 11 and the acknowledgement set to 2.
