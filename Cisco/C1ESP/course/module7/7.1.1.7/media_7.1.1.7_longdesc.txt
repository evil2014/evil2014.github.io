The figure shows the four layers of the T.C.P.I.P. model and focuses on the transport layer.  When a service is sending data it must select between T.C.P. and U.D.P. at the transport layer. The figure shows a list of what each protocol offers.  U.D.P should be selected when the service requires fast delivery, low overhead, no acknowledgement and no resending of data T.C.P. should be selected when the service requires reliable transfer of data, acknowledgements of receipt of data, the resending of lost packets and delivery of data in the order it is sent.
