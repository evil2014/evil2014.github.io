Figure is an animation that shows a computer sending a file to a server using the T.F.T.P. application, which utilizes the U.D.P. at the transport layer.  The data is segmented into six segments and all packets leave the computer and are sent to a router and then directed to the T.F.T.P. server on a remote server farm network.  The server receives all the packets, but since it is using U.D.P. no acknowledgement packet is sent from the server.
