Figure shows the four layers of the T.C.P.I.P. model and how it enables applications on devices to communicate.  The figure highlights the Transport layer, which is responsible for moving data between applications on devices in the network.  The transport layer on the sending device corresponds with the transport layer of the receiving device.
