Figure shows a large amount of data being segmented into 3 separate segments, and it shows the difference between a T.C.P. segment and a U.D.P. segment.  A U.D.P. segment will have only the source and destination ports listed in the header.  A T.C.P. header will have source and destinations ports listed, sequencing information, acknowledgement information, and flow control and management information in each header.
