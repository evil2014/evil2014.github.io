Figure states that T.C.P. and U.D.P. are transport layer protocols that are instrumental in ensuring network communications with different levels of importance are sent and received according to their levels of importance.  A key point is that the type of data will affect whether T.C.P. or U.D.P. will be used as the method of delivery.  And lastly, timing is a factor and will affect how long it takes to send and receive T.C.P. and U.D.P. data transmissions.
