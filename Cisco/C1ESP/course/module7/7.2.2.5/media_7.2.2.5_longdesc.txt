Figure shows the T.C.P. congestion and flow control process.  The figure has a sending computer and a receiving computer.  The window size is set to 3,000.  The sender sends 1,500 bytes of data along with a sequence number of one.  It sends another 1,500 bytes with a sequence number of 1,501.  The receiving computer receives bytes 1 through 1,500 and bytes 1,501 through 3,000.  Now that the window size has been met the receiving computer sends acknowledgement number 3,001 to the sender.  This signifies that it has received the expected amount of data and it is ready for more.  The sender sends another 1,500 bytes of data along with a sequence number of 3,001.  It sends another 1,500 bytes with a sequence number of 4,501.  The receiving computer receives bytes 4,501 through 6,000, but not bytes 3,001 through 4,500 due to congestion at the router.  The receiving computer sends acknowledgement number 3,001 again to the sender.  This signifies that it has not received the next expected segment and in its transmission it reduces the window size to 1,500 because of the lost segment.  If segments are lost because of congestion, the receiver will acknowledge the last received sequential segment and reply with a reduced window size.
