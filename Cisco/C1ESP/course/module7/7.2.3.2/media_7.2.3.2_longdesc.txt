Figure shows data being divided into six datagrams, which are then sent through a network of five routers that are connected with redundant links thereby allowing multiple paths for the datagrams to follow.  They do not arrive at the destination in same order they were sent.  Since these are datagrams utilizing U.D.P., any out of order datagrams delivered will not be reordered and any lost datagrams will not be re-sent.
