Figure shows data being divided into 6 segments, which are each labeled with a sequence number 1 through 6 and sent to remote host.  There are five routers connected with redundant links, thereby allowing multiple paths for the segments to follow.  The segments do not arrive at the destination in same order they were sent.  T.C.P. uses the sequence numbers to re-order the segments back to their original order.
