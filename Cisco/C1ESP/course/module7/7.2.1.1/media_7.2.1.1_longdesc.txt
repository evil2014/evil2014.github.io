Figure is an animation showing a computer connected to a router, which connects to the Internet and has a web server in the cloud.  The animation shows the computer using T.C.P. to send a connection request to the server at the transport layer of the T.C.P.I.P. model.  The server accepts the connection, also at the transport layer, which then completes the connection set-up process.
