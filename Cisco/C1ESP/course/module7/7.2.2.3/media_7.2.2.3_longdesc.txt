Figure is an animation that shows an example of how T.C.P. handles data loss and retransmission.  The source computer sends segment 1 and starts a timer.  The destination computer receives segment one, then forms acknowledgement 1 and request 2 and transmits that back to the source.  The source receives the acknowledgement and the time ends before it times out.  The source computers then sends segment 2 and sets the timer again for segment 2.  Segment 2 is sent, but it is never received by the destination computer.  Timer 2 expires on the source computer, which causes the source to retransmit segment 2 and start a new timer.  The destination computer receives segment two, then forms acknowledgement two and request three, and transmits that back to the source.  The source receives the acknowledgment and the process repeats for segment three.
