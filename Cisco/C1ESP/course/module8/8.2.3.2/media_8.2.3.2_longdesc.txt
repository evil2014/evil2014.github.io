The figure shows the prefix notation used in I.P. v-6 addressing.  The I.P. address in the example is two zero zero one colon zero D B eight colon zero zero zero A colon colon A slash sixty-four.  The figure highlights the first sixty-four bits as the prefix and the second sixty-four as the interface I.D.  The prefix is two zero zero one colon zero D B eight colon zero zero zero A colon zero zero zero zero and the interfacte I.D. zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero  colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero.
