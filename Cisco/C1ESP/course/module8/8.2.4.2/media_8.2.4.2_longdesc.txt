Figure one shows a router with two active gigabit Ethernet ports with a switch on each port and a P.C. connected to each switch.  The router also has an active serial port that is connected to a WAN cloud.  The network address for the gig zero slash zero port is two zero zero one colon zero D B eight colon A C A D colon one colon colon slash sixty-four.  The network address for the gig zero slash one port is two zero zero one colon zero D B eight colon A C A D colon two colon colon slash sixty-four.  The network address for the serial zero slash zero slash zero port is two zero zero one colon zero D B eight colon A C A D colon three colon colon slash sixty-four.  Each router port is assigned the first address in the network. Figure two shows the first step in configuring I.P. v-6 routing, which is assigning addresses to the router ports.  Command line interface mode is shown in the figure for the router. The command to assign an I.P. v-6 address to an interface is to start in global configuration mode, and then move to interface configuration mode.  The first example is for the gigabit ethernet zero slash zero interface.  Once in interface configuration mode the command is i.p. v-6 address two zero zero one colon zero D B eight colon A C A D colon one colon colon one slash sixty-four.  For the gigabit ethernet zero slash one interface the command is i.p. v-6 address two zero zero one colon zero D B eight colon A C A D colon two colon colon one slash sixty-four.  For the serial zero slash zero slash zero interface the command is i.p. v-6 address two zero zero one colon zero D B eight colon A C A D colon three colon colon one slash sixty-four. Figure three shows a window applet used to configure an I.P. v-6 address, a subnet prefix length, a default gateway, and D.N.S. serverâ€™s I.P. addresses on a computer. Figure four is an interactive media element that has the learner configure I.P. v-6 addresses on three router interfaces.
