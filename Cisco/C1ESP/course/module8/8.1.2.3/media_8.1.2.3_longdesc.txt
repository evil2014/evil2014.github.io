Figure one shows one router connected to a switch, and there are four computers connected to the switch.  The network address is ten dot one dot one dot zero slash twenty-four and the four computers have the addresses of ten dot one dot one dot ten slash twenty-four, ten dot one dot one dot eleven slash twenty-four, ten dot one dot one dot twelve slash twenty-four and ten dot one dot one dot zero slash two-hundred fifty four. Figure two highlights the network portion and expands it into binary.  The network portion of the I.P. address is the first twenty four bits which are zero zero zero zero one zero one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one.  The last eight bits is the host portion and that zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero.  The rule for a network address is all zeros in the network portion.  This is true for each of the four computes. Figure three highlights the host portion of the computer with the I.P. address of ten dot one dot one dot ten slash twenty-four.  The host portion is the last octet, which is zero zero zero zero one zero one zero. Figure four lists the broadcast address.  The rule for this address is all ones in the host portion, so the last octet is one one one one one one one one and in decimal the full address is ten dot one dot one dot two-hundred fifty five.
