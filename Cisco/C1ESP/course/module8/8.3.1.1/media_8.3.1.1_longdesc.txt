The figure is an animation that shows a computer with an I.P. v-4 address of 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot 1 sending an I.C.M.P. echo request to a computer with an I.P. v-4 address of 192 dot 168 dot 30 dot 1.  The message travels from the sending computer through a switch to a router.  That router sends the request to another router, then to a switch, and finally to the destination computer.  The receiving computer sends back an I.C.M.P. reply.
