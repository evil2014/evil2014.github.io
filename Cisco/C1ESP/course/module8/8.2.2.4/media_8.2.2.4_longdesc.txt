Figure one shows an I.P. v-6 address in full notation, then after omitting leading zeros, then followed by applying the double colon feature.  The starting address is two zero zero one colon zero D B eight colon zero zero zero zero colon one one one one colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero two zero zero.  After omitting the leading zeros the address becomes two zero zero one colon D B eight colon zero colon one one one one colon zero colon zero colon zero colon two zero zero.  After applying the double colon feature the address becomes two zero zero one colon D B eight colon zero colon one one one one colon colon two zero zero. Figure two shows an I.P. v-6 address in full notation, then after omitting leading zeros, then followed by applying the double colon feature.  The starting address is two zero zero one colon zero D B eight colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon A B C D  colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero one zero zero.  After omitting the leading zeros the address becomes two zero zero one colon D B eight colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon A B C D  colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero one zero zero.  In this example there are two sections that could be replaced by a colon colon.  The first address option after applying the double colon feature becomes two zero zero one colon D B eight colon colon A B C D colon zero colon zero colon one zero zero.  The second option is two zero zero one colon D B eight colon zero colon zero colon A B C D colon colon one zero zero. Figure three shows an I.P. v-6 address in full notation, then after omitting leading zeros, then followed by applying the double colon feature.  The starting address is F E eight zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero one two three colon four five six seven colon eight nine A B colon C D E F.  After omitting the leading zeros the address becomes F E eight zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon one two three colon four five six seven colon eight nine A B colon C D E F.  After applying the double colon feature the address becomes F E eight zero colon colon zero one two three colon four five six seven colon eight nine A B colon C D E F. Figure four shows an I.P. v-6 address in full notation, then after omitting leading zeros, then followed by applying the double colon feature.  The starting address is F E zero two colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero one.  After omitting the leading zeros the address becomes F E zero two colon zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon one.  After applying the double colon feature the address becomes F E zero two colon colon one. Figure five shows an I.P. v-6 address in full notation, then after omitting leading zeros, then followed by applying the double colon feature.  The starting address is F E zero two colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero one colon F F zero zero colon zero two zero zero.  After omitting the leading zeros the address becomes F E zero two colon zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon one colon F F zero zero colon two zero zero.  After applying the double colon feature the address becomes F E zero two colon colon one colon FF zero zero colon two zero zero. Figure seven shows an I.P. v-6 address in full notation, then after omitting leading zeros, then followed by applying the double colon feature.  The starting address is zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero one.  After omitting the leading zeros the address becomes zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon one.  After applying the double colon feature the address becomes colon colon one. Figure eight shows an I.P. v-6 address in full notation, then after omitting leading zeros, then followed by applying the double colon feature.  The starting address is zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero.  After omitting the leading zeros the address becomes zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon zero.  After applying the double colon feature the address becomes colon colon.
