Figure one shows the process of anding a one with a one and is using the one hundred ninety two dot one hundred sixty eight dot ten dot ten slash twenty four address.   The I.P. address and the subnet mask are both listed in binary with the I.P. address above the subnet mask.  In the example the first two bits in the first octet for the I.P. address and the subnet mask are both ones so the network address will start with the left most two bits set to one.  The next octet has the first, third and fifth bits from left to right set to one in the I.P. address, so these bits become set to one in the network address.  The third octet also has the first, third and fifth bits from left to right set to one in the I.P. address, so these bits become set to one in the network address. Figure two fills in the blanks in the network address with zeros since anding a zero and a one will result in zero. Figure three is anding a zero and a zero, which is zero.  The subnet mask is all zeros in the host portion, so the host octet is all zero bits. Figure four is anding a one and a zero, which will equal zero.  This causes all the host bits to be zeros and results in the network identification address of one hundred ninety two dot one hundred sixty eight dot ten dot zero slash twenty four.
