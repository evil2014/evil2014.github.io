Figure one shows the breakdown of an I.P. version 4 address.  The first image highlights an I.P. version 4 address as the decimal value of 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot 10.  The second image highlights the binary octets.  Decimal 192 is equivalent to binary one one zero zero zero zero zero zero.  Decimal 168 is equivalent to binary one zero one zero one zero zero zero.  Decimal 10 is equivalent to binary zero zero zero zero one zero one zero.  The last octet is again 10 and is binary zero zero zero zero one zero one zero. The third image shows the four binary octets combined to give the I.P. address in binary as a total of 32 bits. Figure two shows the eight bits positions that form a byte and their equivalent decimal values.  Each binary bit position represents two raised to a power, starting from two to the power of zero for the right-most bit and going through two raised to the power of 7 for the left-most bit in the eight bit byte.  Working from right to left the values are two raised to the power of zero is decimal one, two raised to the power of one is decimal two, two raised to the power of two is decimal four, two raised to the power of three is decimal eight, two raised to the power of four is decimal sixteen, two raised to the power of five is decimal thirty-two, two raised to the power of six is decimal sixty-four, and two raised to the power of seven is decimal one hundred twenty eight.  Each bit position that has a one effectively turns on that position and a zero turns it off.  The resulting decimal number is the addition of all the on bits added together.
