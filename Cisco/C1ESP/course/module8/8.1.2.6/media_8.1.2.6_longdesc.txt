The figure shows the I.P. address of one hundred ninety two dot one hundred sixty eight dot ten dot ten slash twenty four address, the subnet mask and the network address each in binary form.  The I.P. address is one one zero zero zero zero zero zero one zero one zero one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one zero one zero zero zero zero zero one zero one zero.  The subnet mask is one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero.  The network address is one one zero zero zero zero zero zero one zero one zero one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one zero one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero.
