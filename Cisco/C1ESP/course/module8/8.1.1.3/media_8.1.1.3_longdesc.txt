The figure is an animation that begins with the binary I.P. address of one one zero zero zero zero zero zero  one zero one zero one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero  one zero one zero zero zero zero zero one zero one zero.  This is 4 bytes, or 32 bits.  The animation then translates each one into the decimal number it represents.  The translation in the first octet is that the two left-most bits are on so that is 128 plus 64, which equals 192.  The second octet has the 128 bit, the 32 bit, and the 8 bit on, so this equals 168.  The last two octets are the same pattern which is from left to right the 8 bit and the 2 bit position on, which is equal to 10.  The dotted decimal address therefor is 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot 10.
