The figure is an animation showing a limited broadcast transmission.  A computer with the I.P. address of one hundred seventy two dot sixteen dot four dot one is sending a broadcast message to the broadcast address of two hundred fifty five dot two hundred fifty five dot two hundred fifty five dot two hundred fifty five.  The switch receives the packet and it will send the packet out all of the ports except the port on which the switch received the packet.  In the figure a router receives the broadcast, but the router will drop the message because routers do not forward broadcast messages.
