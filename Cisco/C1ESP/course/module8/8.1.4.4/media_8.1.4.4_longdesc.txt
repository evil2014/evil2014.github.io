Figure one is a table of subnet mask values starting with the class A mask of one one one one one one one one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero  zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero.  This is also a slash eight.  This mask allows for sixteen million seven hundred seventy seven thousand two hundred fourteen host addresses.  The next subnet mask is a slash nine and it allows for eight million three hundred eighty eight thousand six hundred six host addresses.  The pattern listed continues to increase the slash by one up to a slash thirty two, which is called a host route. Figure two is a table of the five classes of I.P. v-4 addresses.  A class A network has the first octet in the range of 1 through 127 and is a slash 8.  A class B network has the first octet in the range of 128 through 191 and is a slash 16.  A class C network has the first octet in the range of 192 through 223 and is a slash 24.  A class D network is the multicast range and has the first octet in the range of 224 through 239 and does not have a slash notation.  A class E network is reserved for experimental use and has the first octet in the range of 240 through 255 and does not have a slash notation.
