Figure one shows the steps to configure the link local address on a router.  Step one is to move to interface configuration mode.  The next command is I.P. v-6 address F E eight zero colon colon one link-local.  The example in the figure is setting three interfaces to the same link local address, F E eight zero colon colon one.  This is acceptable since the address only needs to be unique on the link.  Figure two is showing the output of the show I.P. v-6 interface brief command.  The output is showing three interfaces on the router. Each interface has a different I.P. v-6 address, but the same link local address.
