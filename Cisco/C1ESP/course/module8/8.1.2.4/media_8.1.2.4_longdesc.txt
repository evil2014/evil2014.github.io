Figure one shows the same network as in the previous slide.  The figure is highlighting the host portion and is specifying the first available I.P. address on a network.  The rule is all zeros in the host portion except for the right-most bit, which will be set to one.  For this network the first host is ten dot one dot one dot one, and the binary representation in the host octet is zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one. Figure two is highlighting the host portion and is specifying the last available I.P. address on a network.  The rule is all ones in the host portion except for the right-most bit, which will be set to zero.  For this network the first host is ten dot one dot one dot one, and the binary representation in the host octet is one one one one one one one zero.
