Figure one shows an I.P. v-6 address in full or preferred notation, and then what it looks like after omitting leading zeros.  The starting address is two zero zero one colon zero D B eight colon zero zero zero zero colon one one one one colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero two zero zero.  After omitting the leading zeros the address becomes two zero zero one colon D B eight colon zero colon one one one one colon zero colon zero colon zero colon two zero zero. Figure two shows an I.P. v-6 address in full notation, and then what it looks like after omitting leading zeros.  The starting address is two zero zero one colon zero D B eight colon zero zero zero zero colon A three zero zero colon A B C D colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon one two three four.  After omitting the leading zeros the address becomes two zero zero one colon D B eight colon zero colon A three zero zero colon A B C D colon zero colon zero colon one two three four. Figure three shows an I.P. v-6 address in full notation, and then what it looks like after omitting leading zeros.  The starting address is two zero zero one colon zero D B eight colon zero zero zero A colon one zero  zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon one zero zero zero.  After omitting the leading zeros the address becomes two zero zero one colon D B eight colon A colon one zero zero zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon one zero zero zero.Figure four shows an I.P. v-6 address in full notation, and then what it looks like after omitting leading zeros.  The starting address is F E eight zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero one two three colon four five six seven colon eight nine A B colon C D E F.  After omitting the leading zeros the address becomes F E eight zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon one two three colon four five six seven colon eight nine A B colon C D E F. Figure five shows an I.P. v-6 address in full notation, and then what it looks like after omitting leading zeros.  The starting address is F E zero two colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero one.  After omitting the leading zeros the address becomes F E zero two colon zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon one. Figure six shows an I.P. v-6 address in full notation, and then what it looks like after omitting leading zeros.  The starting address is F E zero two colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero one colon F F zero zero colon zero two zero zero.  After omitting the leading zeros the address becomes F E zero two colon zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon one colon F F zero zero colon two zero zero.Figure seven shows an I.P. v-6 address in full notation, and then what it looks like after omitting leading zeros.  The starting address is zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero one.  After omitting the leading zeros the address becomes zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon one. Figure eight shows an I.P. v-6 address in full notation, and then what it looks like after omitting leading zeros.  The starting address is zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero.  After omitting the leading zeros the address becomes zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon zero colon zero.
