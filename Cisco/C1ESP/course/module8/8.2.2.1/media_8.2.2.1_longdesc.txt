Figure one is a table listing the decimal numbers zero through fifteen, the hexadecimal equivalent which is zero through nine, and then the letters A through F.  Hexadecimal A is equivalent to decimal ten, Hexadecimal B is equivalent to decimal eleven, Hexadecimal C is equivalent to decimal twelve, Hexadecimal D is equivalent to decimal thirteen, Hexadecimal E is equivalent to decimal fourteen, and Hexadecimal F is equivalent to decimal fifteen.  The last column is the binary representation of decimal zero through fifteen. Figure two lists two digit hexadecimal values, and their decimal and binary equivalents for a select set of numbers.  For example the hexadecimal number zero A is equivalent to the decimal number ten and the binary value is zero zero zero zero one zero one zero.  The first zero in the hexadecimal number corresponds to the first four bit positions working left to right in the binary number, and the second hexadecimal digit corresponds to the last four bit positions.  Another example is the hexadecimal number C zero is equivalent to the decimal number one hundred ninety two and the binary value is one one zero zero zero zero zero zero.
