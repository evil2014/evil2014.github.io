Figure one is the first step in calculating a binary number when given a decimal number.  The starting decimal number is 168.  In step one the decimal number is compared to the left-most binary bit, which is 128 and the question of “do I need 128 to make 168?” is posed.  The answer is yes so the 128 bit is turned on and the value of 128 is subtracted from 168.  The result is 40. Figure two moves to the next bit and asks the question “do I need 64 to make 40?”.  The answer is no, so this bit is turned off with a zero. Figure three moves to the next bit and asks the question “do I need 32 to make 40?”.  The answer is yes so the bit is turned on and 32 is subtracted from 40 for a result of 8. Figure four moves to the next bit and asks the question “do I need 16 to make 8?”.  The answer is no, so this bit is turned off with a zero. Figure five moves to the next bit and asks the question “do I need 8 to make 8?”.  The answer is yes so the bit is turned on and 8 is subtracted from 8 for a result of 0. Figure six shows the last two bits are set to zero since there is no remainder to calculate bits.  The final binary equivalent of 168 is one zero one zero one zero zero zero.
