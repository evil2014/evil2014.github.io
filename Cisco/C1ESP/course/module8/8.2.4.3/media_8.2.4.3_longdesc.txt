The figure shows the router solicitation process by displaying a computer sending a request for I.P. v-6 addressing information from all I.P. v-6 routers.  The figure also shows a router advertisement message being sent by a router.  This message can have one of three options configured, option one gives all the necessary addressing information, option two sets some addressing options but relies on a D.H.C.P. v-6 server for some settings, and option three relies solely on a D.H.C.P. v-6 server for all addressing information.  The router advertisement in the figure is using option one and it is telling the computer the prefix, prefix-length, and default gateway to use.
