The figure shows a computer sending an I.P. v-6 router solicitation message looking for addressing information.  A router responds with a router advertisement message. This message can have one of three options configured, option one gives all the necessary addressing information, option two sets some addressing options but relies on a D.H.C.P. v-6 server for some settings, and option three relies solely on a D.H.C.P. v-6 server for all addressing information.  The router advertisement in the figure is using option one and it is telling the computer the prefix, prefix-length, and the default gateway to use.
