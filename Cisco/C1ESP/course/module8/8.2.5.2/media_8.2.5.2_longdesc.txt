The figure shows an I.P. v-6 solicited node multicast address being formed from an I.P. v-6 global unicast address.  The example in the figure lists the unicast address bits in hexadecimal, therefore the format of the first one hundred four binary bits in hexadecimal is the combination of the global routing prefix, the subnet I.D., and a portion of the interface I.D.  In the example the global routing prefix of the address is two zero zero one colon zero D B eight colon A C A D, the subnet I.D. is zero zero zero one, and the interface I.D. is zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero.  The remaining twenty-four binary bits are the last twenty-four bits of the interface I.D., which in the example is represented by hexadecimal zero zero colon zero zero one zero.  The figure then shows the first one hundred four bits being changed to form the solicited node multicast address.  These first one hundred four become F F zero two colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero one colon F F.  The final twenty-four bits stay their original values, which is hexadecimal zero zero colon zero zero one zero.
