The figure shows two additional messages within the I.C.M.P. v-6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol, the neighbor solicitation, and the duplicate address detection.  A neighbor solicitation message is sent across a link by a device that is looking for the MAC address of a known I.P. v-6 address.  In the figure, a computer is sending the neighbor solicitation message looking for the Ethernet MAC address of the device that has the I.P. v-6 address of two zero zero one colon D B 8 colon A C A D colon one colon colon two zero.  The next message is the duplicate address detection, and a computer is assigned an I.P. v-6 address of two zero zero one colon D B 8 colon A C A D colon one colon colon three zero. Before it begins to use the address it sends out a request asking if any other device is currently using the specified address.
