Figure one shows a router with a switch on a Fast Ethernet port.  There are two computers, a server, and a printer attached to the switch.  A computer with a source address of F E eight zero colon colon A A A A slash sixty-four sends a print job to the printer, which has an address of F E eight zero colon colon D D D D  slash sixty-four.  The switch will forward the print job to the printer because the two devices are on the same link.  The router has a link local address of F E eight zero colon colon one slash sixty-four.  In the figure there is a red X on the two other Fast Ethernet ports, not the one with the switch.  The x indicates that the router will not route any link local addresses. Figure two shows the format of the I.P. v-6 link local address in its expanded form.  The address range is F E eight zero colon colon slash ten.  This converts to the binary value of one one one one colon one one one zero colon one zero for the first 10 bits.  This leaves fifty-four bits remaining for network addressing.  The interface identification is the last sixty-four bits and can be either automatically or manually configured.
