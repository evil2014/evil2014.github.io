Figure one shows the first three bits in an I.P. v-6 address being set to zero zero one.  This indicates a global unicast address.  The figure shows the range of binary bits for the first hextet, which is the first 16 binary bits.  The range is from  zero zero one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero through zero zero one one one one one one one one one one one one one one.  This range in hexadecimal is two zero zero zero through three F F F. Figure two shows the I.P. v-6 global routing prefix of a slash forty eight.  The first forty eight bits serve as the global routing prefix and the next sixteen bits are used as a subnet identifier.  The slash forty-eight routing prefix plus the sixteen bit subnet identifier form the slash sixty-four prefix.   The remaining sixty-four bits are the interface identifier. Figure three shows how to read a global unicast address.  The address is listed first as a compressed address, and it is 2 zero zero one colon D B eight colon A C A D colon 1 colon colon one zero.  The first four hextets is the prefix and the last four hextets is the interface identifier.  This expands to two zero zero one colon zero D B eight colon A C A D colon zero zero zero one colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero one zero.  The global routing prefix is two zero zero one colon zero D B eight colon A C A D.  The subnet I.D. is zero zero one and the interface I.D. zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero zero zero colon zero zero one zero.
