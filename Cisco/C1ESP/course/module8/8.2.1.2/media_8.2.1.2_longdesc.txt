Figure one shows a router connected to three network segments. Each has a computer running I.P. version 4 and I.P. version 6 in dual0stack mode, which allows the two protocols to co-exist. Figure two shows two routers. Each router has a network segment on one of the Fast Ethernet ports.  There is a computer on each network segment that is running only I.P. version 6.  There is a an I.P. version 4 only tunnel connecting the two routers. The tunnel encapsulates the I.P. version 6 packet within an I.P. version 4 packet for transmission. Figure three shows a router that has an I.P. version 6 only segment on one Fast Ethernet port and an I.P. version 4 only segment on another Fast Ethernet port.  The router is serving as a Network Address Translation 64 device allowing I.P. version 6 enabled devices to communicate with I.P. version 4 enabled devices.
