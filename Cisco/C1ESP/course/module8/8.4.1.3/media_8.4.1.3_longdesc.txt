The figure shows the breakdown of an I.P. version 4 address.  The address is listed in both decimal and binary.  The decimal value is 192 dot 168 dot 10 dot 10.  The binary equivalent of 192 is one one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero.  Decimal 168 is equivalent to binary one zero one zero one zero zero zero.  Decimal 10 is equivalent to binary zero zero zero zero one zero one zero.  The last octet is again 10 and is binary zero zero zero zero one zero one zero.  The subnet mask is listed in decimal as 255 dot 255 dot 255 dot zero.  The binary equivalent is one one one one one one one one dot one one one one one one one one dot one one one one one one one one dot zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero.  This is a class C I.P. v-4 network so the first three octets represent the network portion and the last host represents the host portion.
