The figure is an animation of the trace route process.  A host forms an echo request with a T T L of one and a destination I.P. address and sends the packet.  The command line syntax for the example is trace r t one hundred ninety two dot one hundred sixty eight dot one dot two.  The first router receives this packet and it decrements the T T L by one since it is a hop.  The T T L is now zero so the packet is returned to the sender.  The sending host does not receive the expected echo reply so it increases the T T L to a value of two and resends the packet.  The first router receives the packet and decrements the T T L by one.  The T T L now has a value of one so the router sends the packet to the next router, and this router will decrement the T T L by one.  Now that the T T L is zero the router returns the packet to the sender.  The sender increments the T T L to three and again sends the packet through the network.  When the third router receives the packet the T T L is decremented to zero and the packet is returned to the sender.  Still not receiving an echo reply, the sender increases the T T L to four and sends it across the network.  The packet moves through three routers and now has a T T L of one.  The receiving host receives the packet and sends back the echo reply to the sender.
