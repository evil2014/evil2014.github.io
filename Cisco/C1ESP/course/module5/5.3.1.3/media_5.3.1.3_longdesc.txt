Figure shows 2 diagrams.  One is a server connected to a hub which is connected to a switch.  In this diagram, data can only flow in one direction at a time between the server and the switch.  This is known as half duplex.   The second diagram replaces the hub with another switch.  In this diagram, data can flow in both directions simultaneously.  This is known as full duplex.
