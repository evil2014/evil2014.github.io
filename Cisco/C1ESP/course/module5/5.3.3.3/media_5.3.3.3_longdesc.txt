Figure shows a LAN consisting of a layer 3 switch.  There are 2 standard layer 2 switches attached to the layer 3 switch.  Each layer 2 switch has 2 P.C.s attached.  There are 2 V. LANs, Faculty (v. lan 10) and Student (v. lan 20).  Each layer 2 switch is connected to the layer 3 switch using a Trunk.  The layer 3 switch has two switched virtual interfaces (S.V.I.s) used to route between the two V. LANs.
