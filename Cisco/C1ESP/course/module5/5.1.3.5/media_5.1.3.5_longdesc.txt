This animation shows several computers connected to a switch.  Host one wants to send a packet to a group of computers (a multicast).  The diagram shows the M.A.C. address and I.P. address of host 1.  The graphic also shows the frame with source and destination M.A.C. address and the encapsulated packet with source and destination I.P. address.  The destination I.P. address is a multicast address (224 dot 0 dot 0 dot 200) and the destination M.A.C. address is special.  It starts with 0 1 dash 0 0 dash 5 E and ends with the hexadecimal equivalent of the last three octets of the I.P. multicast address, 0 0 dash 0 0 dash C 8.  When the animation plays, the frame travels from host 1 to the selected hosts that are listening to the multicast address.
