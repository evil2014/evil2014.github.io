This interactive activity shows how a switch uses a M.A.C. address table to forward frames.  This table maps a M.A.C. address to a port on the switch.  Learners first click a source P.C. and then a destination P.C. and click the "Send" button.  The table highlights the source and destination M.A.C. address in the table which is associated with a specific port.
