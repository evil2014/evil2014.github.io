Figure one is an animation.  The animation shows how the Ethernet Frame header and trailer are wrapped around the I.P. packet.  This process is called encapsulation. Figure two is an animation.  The animation shows that an I.P. packet can move across different types of media.  Since the M.A.C. sublayer of the data link layer is responsible for placing the frame on the wire, I.P. is media independent.   This figure demonstrates how frames are encapsulated based on the technology of the link.
