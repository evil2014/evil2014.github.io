This animation shows several computers connected to a switch.  Host one wants to send a packet to a server (a unicast).  The diagram shows the M.A.C. address and I.P. address of both host 1 and the server.  The graphic also shows the frame with source and destination M.A.C. address and the encapsulated packet with source and destination I.P. address.  When the animation plays, the frame travels from host 1 to the server since the switch forwards the frame based on M.A.C. address and knows where the server is located.
