Figure shows the C.L.I. of a layer 3 switch.  The output shows how to configure an interface to act as a routed interface using the "no switchport" command followed by a standard interface configuration sequence to set I.P. address and subnet mask.  Then the "show I.P. interface brief" command is issued to show the interface is configured with I.P. address and it is up.
