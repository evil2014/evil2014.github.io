Figure shows four hosts and a router on a LAN segment.  Each is labeled with its I.P. address and M.A.C. address.  Host C has a red X over it.  This figure demonstrates that Host C is being removed from the network.  It is critical that arp cache entries be purged after some time has passed, otherwise data will be forwarded incorrectly.
