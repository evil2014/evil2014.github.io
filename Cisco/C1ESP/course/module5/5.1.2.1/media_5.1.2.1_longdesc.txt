Figure one is an interactive media.  This interactive media shows a time line with Ethernet standards from nineteen seventy three through two thousand six.  As you move the slider closer to two thousand six, you see the newer standards and their description.  At the same time, there is a graphic that represents bandwidth and it grows in size as the slider moves closer to two thousand six. Figure two shows the structure for the two styles of Ethernet framing, 8 0 2 dot 3 and Ethernet two.
