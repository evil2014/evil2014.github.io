Figure one shows the seven layers of the O.S.I. model with the lower two shaded.  This figure demonstrates that Ethernet spans layers 1 and 2.  8 0 2 dot 3 covers layer 1 and the lower half (M.A.C.) of layer 2.  8 0 2 dot 2 covers the upper half of layer 2, L.L.C. Figure two shows a different representation of how the different implementations of Ethernet span the layers.  In this figure, we see that Ethernet, Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet spans layer 1 and the lower half of 2.  These are the 8 0 2 dot 3 specifications.
