This animation shows several computers connected to a switch.  Host one wants to send a packet to all other hosts (a broadcast).  The diagram shows the M.A.C. address and I.P. address of host 1.  The graphic also shows the frame with source and destination M.A.C. address and the encapsulated packet with source and destination I.P. address.  The destination M.A.C. address is formed by all Fs (the broadcast M.A.C. address).  When the animation plays, the frame travels from host 1 to all other hosts connected to the switch.
