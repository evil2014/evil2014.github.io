This animation shows how a frame is forwarded.  There are four computers on shared media.  Each has a different M.A.C. address.  Computer 1 sends a frame to Computer 3 using the correct M.A.C. addresses for source and destination.  The frame is forwarded to all of the computers.  Computers 2 and 4 ignore the frame since the destination M.A.C. address does not match their own.
