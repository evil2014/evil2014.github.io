Figure one shows four hosts and a router on a LAN segment.  Each is labeled with its I.P. address and M.A.C. address.  Host A wants to send data to a host on a different LAN.  The host sends an arp request for its gateway, the router. Figure two shows four hosts and a router on a LAN segment.  Each is labeled with its I.P. address and M.A.C. address.  Host A wants to send data to a host on a different LAN.  The host sends an arp request for its gateway, the router.  All of the other hosts receive the request. Figure three shows four hosts and a router on a LAN segment.  Each is labeled with its I.P. address and M.A.C. address.  Host A wants to send data to a host on a different LAN.  The host sends an arp request for its gateway, the router.  All of the other hosts receive the request.  The router responds with a unicast to Host A. Figure four shows four hosts and a router on a LAN segment.  Each is labeled with its I.P. address and M.A.C. address.  Host A wants to send data to a host on a different LAN.  The host sends an arp request for its gateway, the router.  All of the other hosts receive the request.  The router responds with a unicast to Host A and Host A adds an entry to its arp cache. Figure five shows four hosts and a router on a LAN segment.  Each is labeled with its I.P. address and M.A.C. address.  Host A wants to send data to a host on a different LAN.  The host sends an arp request for its gateway, the router.  All of the other hosts receive the request.  The router responds with a unicast to Host A and Host A adds an entry to its arp cache.  Now Host A can forward the original data to the router for further forwarding.
