Figure one shows the types of data carried on a converged data network.  These data include real time traffic, such as video conferencing and voice over I.P., and web content; transactional traffic, such as ordering and billing; streaming traffic, such as videos, on-demand; bulk traffic such as e-mail and printer files. Figure two shows the use of a queuing to prioritize communications where voice over I.P. is highest priority and is sent through a network first.   Next is medium priority data, such as financial transactions.  This is followed lastly by web traffic, which is low priority data.  Figure three lists an example demonstrating the benefit of quality of service on streaming video data traffic.
