Figure shows a packet-switched Data Network.  Prior to transmission, each communication is broken into packets which are addressed and numbered, and each packet can take a different route to reach its destination.  Packets are routed according to best path available at the time.  Once they are received at the destination they are reassembled in the original sequence.
