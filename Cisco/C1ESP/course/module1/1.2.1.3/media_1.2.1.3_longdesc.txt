Figure is an animation that shows four interconnected routers with redundant links.  Three data packets are sent, the first one is a high priority message and it has a Q.O.S. tag applied to it, so it will be delivered quickly.  The second packet being sent from a router becomes damaged in transit and is not received by another router.  The receiving router recognizes that a packet is missing and requests a retransmission.  The third packet arrives at a router that has two path options for delivery and the router makes a decision as to which path to use.
