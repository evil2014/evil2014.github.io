Figure one shows redundant links between routers which allow for alternate paths providing fault tolerance. Figure two shows devices easily being added to existing network, demonstrating scalability. Figure three shows how quality of service will guarantee proper data delivery.  For example, web pages will have a lower priority and streaming media will be given higher priority to ensure uninterrupted user experience. Figure four shows a router requiring a user name and a password to access it, thereby giving security to the device.  Devices such as routers can also be secured from physical access by locking the room where they are stored.
