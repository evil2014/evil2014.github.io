Figure shows the I.P. version 4 routing table on a P.C. and how the P.C. uses the routing table to determine how to forward a packet to a destination.  The P.C. is trying to send a packet to a computer on the same LAN.  The network address is highlighted in the routing table.  Since the destination I.P. address is on the same LAN as the P.C., it determines that it will forward the packet out the LAN interface on the P.C. Figure two shows the I.P. version 4 routing table on a P.C. and how the P.C. uses the routing table to determine how to forward a packet to a destination.  The P.C. is trying to send a packet to a computer on a different network.  The P.C. is not aware of the destination so the default gateway is highlighted.  The packet will be forwarded to the router's LAN interface.
