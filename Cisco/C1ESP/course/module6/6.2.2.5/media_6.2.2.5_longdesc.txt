Figure shows two routers connected by a serial connection.  Each router has two LANs attached.  The output from "show i.p. route" is displayed for one of the routers. The two routes learned by E.I.G.R.P. have the next hop interface highlighted in orange.  The next hop is the I.P. address of the WAN interface on the remote router.
