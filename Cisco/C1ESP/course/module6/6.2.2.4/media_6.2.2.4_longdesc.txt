Figure shows a network and a small portion of the routing table from a router.  There are 7 columns highlighted.  One that identifies how the route was learned (shaded in green), one that identifies the destination network and how it is connected (shaded in pink), one that shows the administrative distance (trustworthiness) of the route (shaded in darker orange), one that shows the metric to reach the destination network (shaded in purple),  one  that identifies the next hop to the destination network (shaded in light orange), one that identifies the elapsed time since the route was learned (shaded in light green) and one that identifies the interface which  a packet will be forwarded out of to get to the destination network (yellow).
