Figure shows two routers connected by a serial connection.  Each router has two LANs attached.  The output from "show i.p. route" is displayed for one of the routers. The output contains all networks that this router has in its routing table.  They include the directly connected networks, denoted by a "C" in the routing table and the remote networks, denoted by a different code depending on the routing protocol running on the router.  This router is running E.I.G.R.P. so the code is a "D".  For each directly connected network there are 2 entries.  One with a code of "C" and one with a code of "L".  The "L" is new as of I.O.S. 15 and refers to local networks.
