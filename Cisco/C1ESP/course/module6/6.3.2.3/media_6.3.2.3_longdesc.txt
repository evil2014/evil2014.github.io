Figure one shows the boot up process.  First the router performs a P.O.S.T. and loads the bootstrap.  Both are found in ROM.  Secondly the router loads the I.O.S. found in flash or by T.F.T.P. Finally the router loads the startup configuration, found in N.V. Ram or by T.F.T.P. or console. Figure two highlights the POST section and shows the output directed to the console at C.L.I. Figure three highlights the loading of the I.O.S. and shows the output directed to the console at C.L.I. Figure four highlights the loading of the startup configuration and shows the output directed to the console at C.L.I.
