Figure one shows a network with a worker connected to a LAN.  The figure demonstrates how to configure a switch with a management interface (v. LAN 1) and a default gateway so a network administrator can manage the switch remotely.  Without these configured, you cannot connect to a switch remotely. Figure two is an interactive activity allowing the learner to practice configuring a management interface and default gateway on a switch.
