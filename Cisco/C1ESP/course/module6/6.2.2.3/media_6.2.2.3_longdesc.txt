Figure shows a network and a small portion of the routing table from a router.  There are 3 columns highlighted.  One that identifies how the route was learned (shaded in green), one that identifies the destination network and how it is connected (shaded in pink) and one that identifies the interface which a packet will be forward out of to get to the destination network (shaded in orange).
