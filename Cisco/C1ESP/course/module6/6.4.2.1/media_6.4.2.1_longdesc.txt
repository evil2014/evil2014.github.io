Figure one shows a network with the C.L.I. of a router.  The C.L.I. shows the commands to configure an ethernet interface with I.P. address, subnet mask and description.  It also shows how to turn the interface on using the "no shutdown" command. Figure two is an interactive activity allowing the learner to practice the basic interface configuration commands.
