Figure shows four images intended to represent the concepts of hierarchy, modularity, resiliency, and flexibility.  Hierarchy is represented by a pyramid of balls and rods.  Modularity is represented by a cube made up of smaller cubes.  Resiliency is represented by several gears interconnected. Flexibility is represented by a flexible hose.
