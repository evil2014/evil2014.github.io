Figure one shows a topology of router one connected to a frame relay switch with a WAN link, which is connected to another frame relay switch.  The second frame relay switch has a WAN link connected to router two.  The figure is an animation that shows router one is a D.T.E. device and it sends a status inquiry message to the frame relay, which is a D.C.E.  The D.C.E. responds with a status message that includes D.L.C.I. numbers. Figure two shows the same topology as figure one. This animation shows the process of inverse ARP.  Router one contains a D.L.C.I. identifier, but the router does not know the corresponding I.P. address.  The router sends an inverse ARP request to the frame relay switch, which then forwards it to the next frame relay switch.  The request is forwarded to router two, which sends an inverse ARP response that includes the I.P. address of router two.  This allows router one to associate the D.L.C.I. to a destination I.P. address.
