Figure one shows the standard frame relay frame. The address field showing the field positions for the D.L.C.I. and other control bits, such as the F.E.C.N. bit, the B.E.C.N. bit, the D.E. and the E.A. bits is expanded. Figure two shows two routers connected to the same frame relay switch, which is connected to a frame relay cloud.  The figure is an animation that shows four frames sent from a router to the frame relay cloud, and the first switch in the cloud begins to queue the frames.  As the queue begins to fill up the switch sets the F.E.C.N. bit for frames sent upstream and the B.E.C.N. bit is set on frames that are sent to downstream devices.
