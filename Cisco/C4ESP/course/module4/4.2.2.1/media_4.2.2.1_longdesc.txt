Figure one shows one physical interface of router 1 connected to three remote routers through a frame relay non broadcast multi access configuration, which is a hub and spoke topology.  In this network, updates received on a physical interface are not retransmitted out that same interface, this is known as split horizon.  Figure two shows three routers connecting to a frame relay cloud with a WAN link.  Each router has a D.L.C.I. to each of the other two routers configured.  Router one has D.L.C.I. 102 mapped to router two, and D.L.C.I. 103 mapped to router three.  Router two has D.L.C.I. 201 mapped to router one, and D.L.C.I. 203 mapped to router three.  Router three has D.L.C.I. 302 mapped to router two and D.L.C.I. 301 mapped to router one. The network address is ten dot one dot one dot zero with a slash twenty four mask.  The serial interface on router one is ten dot one dot one dot one.  The serial interface on router two is ten dot one dot one dot two, and the serial interface on router three is ten dot one dot one dot three.  The three serial ports also have I.P. version 6 address configured.  Router 2 is sending a routing update out of port serial zero slash zero slash one, which is virtual circuit 201 and connected to serial zero slash zero slash one of router 1. This port on router 1 also has a virtual circuit mapped to router 3.  The routing update will not be sent to router 3 due to the split horizon rule.  Figure three has the same topology as the previous figure and is showing router one retransmitting broadcast traffic out the sane interface in which it was received. Figure four shows one physical interface of router 1 connected to three remote routers through a frame relay non broadcast multi access configuration, which is a hub and spoke topology.  The routers are running the routing protocol O.S.P.F.  In the figure the hub router is router 1 and it has been configured as the O.S.P.F. Designated Router.
