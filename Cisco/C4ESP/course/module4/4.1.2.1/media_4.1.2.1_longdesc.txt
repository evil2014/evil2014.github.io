Figure one is an animation that shows a packet being sent by one router or node through a series of frame relay switches and being received by another router or node. Figure two shows four routers. Each router has a WAN connection to a cloud of frame relay switches.  Each WAN link is identified by a locally significant D.L.C.I. value. Figure three is an animation showing a packet being sent from a router into a frame relay cloud of switches.  As the packet leaves each device a new D.L.C.I. is placed on the frame to identify the next frame relay device.
