Figure one shows a wire used to represent a single interface. Inside the wire are multiple smaller wires used to represent sub interfaces.  Figure two shows one physical interface of router 1 connected to three remote routers through a frame relay cloud.  The serial zero slash zero slash zero interface of router 1 has three virtual circuits configured, each is connected to a different router, and each is a different subnet.  This is a point to point sub interface configuration. Figure three shows the same topology as the previous slide, however, now each remote router is in the same subnet. This is a multipoint sub interface connection.
