Figure one shows a hub and spoke topology of routers.  One router is in the middle of the diagram and it has five WAN connections, each to a different router.  Figure two shows a frame relay star topology.  This diagram contains the same six routers as the previous figure, but the arrangement is in a circle and the central router has five D.L.C.I. virtual circuits on the one physical link.
