Figure one shows the output from the command show frame hyphen relay map.  This command will display the interfaces, the associated I.P. addresses, and the mapped D.L.C.I.  In the example the serial zero slash zero slash one of router R.1. is listed as i.p.v.6. two zero zero one colon d b eight colon c a f e colon one colon colon two 102, i.p.v.6. f e eight zero colon colon two 102 and i.p. ten dot one dot one dot two D.L.C.I. 102.  The figure also shows the serial zero slash zero slash one of router 2 and it is listed as i.p.v.6. two zero zero one colon d b eight colon c a f e colon one colon colon one 201, i.p.v.6. f e eight zero colon colon one 201 and i.p. ten dot one dot one dot one D.L.C.I. 201. Figure two is an interactive activity that allows the learner to configure static Frame Relay maps on a router.
