Figure one shows five routers in a full mesh topology.  This diagram shows a link between each router, therefore the figure is showing 10 WAN links. Figure two shows a frame relay mesh topology that has each of the five routers with one physical connection to the frame relay cloud, and then each connection has four virtual circuits configured.
