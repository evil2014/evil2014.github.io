Figure one shows four routers. Each router has a WAN connection to a cloud of frame relay switches.  Three of the four routers have connections labeled as D.L.C.I..  The first and second routers both have D.L.C.I. 319, and the second and third routers have D.L.C.I. 102.  This shows multiple virtual circuits on a single access line are differentiated by the D.L.C.I. value. Figure two shows a six city topology with one city identified as the main office, and therefore requiring a connection to each of the other sites.  These connections are virtual circuits and are identified with D.L.C.I. values.  The figure has a table listing each virtual circuit and allows the learner to click each entry. The corresponding link in the topology is then highlighted.
