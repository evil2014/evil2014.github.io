Figure one shows three routers connecting to a frame relay cloud with a WAN link.  Each router has a D.L.C.I. to each of the other two routers configured.  Router one has D.L.C.I. 102 mapped to router two, and D.L.C.I. 103 mapped to router three.  Router two has D.L.C.I. 201 mapped to router one, and D.L.C.I. 203 mapped to router three.  Router three has D.L.C.I. 302 mapped to router two and D.L.C.I. 301 mapped to router one.  The network address is ten dot one dot one dot zero with a slash twenty four mask.  The serial interface on router one is ten dot one dot one dot one.  The serial interface on router two is ten dot one dot one dot two, and the serial interface on router three is ten dot one dot one dot three.  Figure two shows the command used for static mapping of a D.L.C.I. on a router.  The command is entered in interface configuration mode and the syntax in the figure is frame hyphen relay map i.p. ten dot one dot one dot two 102 broadcast. Figure three shows the output of the command, show frame hyphen relay map.  This command will display the interface being used for virtual circuits, the state of the interface, and both the i.p. address and the D.L.C.I.
