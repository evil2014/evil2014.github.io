Figure one shows three routers connecting to a frame relay cloud with a WAN link.  Each router has a D.L.C.I. to each of the other two routers configured.  Router one has D.L.C.I. 102 mapped to router two, and D.L.C.I. 103 mapped to router three.  Router two has D.L.C.I. 201 mapped to router one, and D.L.C.I. 203 mapped to router three.  Router three has D.L.C.I. 302 mapped to router two and D.L.C.I. 301 mapped to router one. The network address is ten dot one dot one dot zero with a slash twenty four mask.  The serial interface on router one is ten dot one dot one dot one.  The serial interface on router two is ten dot one dot one dot two, and the serial interface on router three is ten dot one dot one dot three.  The three serial ports also have I.P. version 6 address configured. Figure two shows parameters for configuring frame relay.  The command parameters include the protocol, the protocol address, the D.L.C.I., and the broadcast keyword. Figure three shows the configuration for mapping virtual circuits on a router.  The figure is in interface configuration mode and the first command is frame hyphen relay map i.p.v.6. two zero zero one colon d b eight colon c a f e colon one colon colon two 102.  The last command is frame hyphen relay map i.p.v.6. f e eight zero colon colon two broadcast.
