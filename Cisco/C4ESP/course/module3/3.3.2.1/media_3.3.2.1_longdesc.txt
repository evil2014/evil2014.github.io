Figure shows the two p.p.p. authentication protocols.  The first diagram shows the pap two way handshake.  In this diagram a remote router sends a username and a password in clear text to another router for authentication.  The receiving router processes the information and returns either an accept or reject message.  The second diagram is the CHAP three way handshake method.  After the remote router asks to make a connection, the receiving router sends a challenge to the sender.  The sender responds by sending a username and the hashed password.  The third step is when the receiving router sends either an accept or reject message to the sender.
