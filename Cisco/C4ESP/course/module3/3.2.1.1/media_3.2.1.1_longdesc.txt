Figure shows two topologies.  The first topology consists of two routers connected together by a WAN link that is using H.D.L.C., which is the default encapsulation method on a Cisco router.  The second topology is also two routers connected together by a WAN link, but this connection is using a P.P.P. link since at least one router is a non Cisco router.
