Figure one shows the topology of network equipment and the demarcation point for the United States. The topology for International networks is shown as a comparison.  The U.S. demarcation point is at the local loop and the service provider is responsible for the equipment connecting to the local loop.  The customer is responsible for the equipment inside the network, such as the C.S.U. slash D.S.U.  In International networks, the N.T.U. is part of the service providerâ€™s responsibility. Figure two shows a picture of a T1 slash E1 module with an embedded C.S.U. slash D.S.U.
