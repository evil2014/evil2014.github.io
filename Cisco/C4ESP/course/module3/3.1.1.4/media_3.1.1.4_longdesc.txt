Figure shows time division multiplexing between two multi plexers.  The sending side has three individual devices labeled D, E, and F. Each device is sending data to the multiplexer.  The multiplexer will accept all the data and will transmit the data from each device in equal time slots.  In the example, there are three data packets being sent from each of the three devices.  The pattern is packet D, packet E, and packet F.  This pattern repeats until all data is sent.  The multiplexer at the other end receives the data and is able to assemble packets from the different devices back into the original message. The WAN technologies of T 1, E 1, and I.S.D.N. are common examples of synchronous T.D.M.
