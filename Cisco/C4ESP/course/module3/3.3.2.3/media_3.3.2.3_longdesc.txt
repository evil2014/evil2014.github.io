Figure one through three show the initiation of a CHAP connection between two routers.  In figure one, router three initiates the three way handshake and sends a challenge message to router one. Figure two shows router 1 responding to the challenge request by sending its CHAP username along with a hash value for the password. Figure three shows router 3 evaluating the username and validating the hash against the hash of the password in the database.
