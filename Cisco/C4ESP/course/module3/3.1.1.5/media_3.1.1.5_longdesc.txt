Figure shows statistical time division multiplexing between two multiplexers.  The sending side has three devices labeled D, E, and F. Each device is sending data to the multiplexer.  The multiplexer will accept all the data and will transmit the data from each device using a variable time slot length, which allows channels to compete for any free slot space.  In the example, there are nine data packets being sent across the network. Based on need to transmit, there are four packets from D, three packets from E, and two packets from F.  The multiplexer at the other end receives the data and is able to assemble packets from the different devices back into the original message based on identification information on each transmission.
