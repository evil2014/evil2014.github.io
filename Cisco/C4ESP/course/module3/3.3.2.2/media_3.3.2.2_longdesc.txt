Figure one shows the initiation of a P.P.P. connection.  In the figure, router 1 is attempting to connect to router 3.  Router 1 sends a username and a password to router 3.  Figure two shows that router 3 will evaluate the username and password via its local database. Router 3 will either accept or reject the connection.  This is the PAP 2 way handshake.
