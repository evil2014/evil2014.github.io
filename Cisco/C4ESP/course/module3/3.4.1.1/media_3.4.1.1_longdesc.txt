Authentication is used to display authentication protocol messages including CHAP and PAP exchanges. Compression is used to display information specific to the exchange of P.P.P connections using M.P.P.C. C.D.C.P is used to display protocol errors and statistics associated with P.P.P. connection negotiations using M.S.C.B.
