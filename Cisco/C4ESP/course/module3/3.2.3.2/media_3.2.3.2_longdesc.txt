Figure one shows more details regarding the P.P.P. link establishment.  The first router sends an L.C.P. configure request to the receiving router, which in turn will send an L.C.P. configure acknowledgement back. Figure two shows P.P.P. link maintenance messages being sent between the two routers.  The figure shows echo requests, echo reply messages, and code reject messages being sent between them. Figure three shows one router sending an L.C.P. terminate request message to the other router, which in turn responds with an L.C.P. terminate ack message.
