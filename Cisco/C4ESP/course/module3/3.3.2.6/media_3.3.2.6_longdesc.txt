Figure one shows the configuration file for two routers using PAP authentication between them.  The password set on each router, the fact that the usernames are configured to be the hostname of the connecting router, and the fact that the password is the same password on each router is highlighted.  The figure also highlights the command p.p.p. pap sent hyphen username R 1 password same one.  In this line the actual password is same one. Figure two is an interactive activity that allows the learner to configure PAP authentication on a serial interface on a router. Figure three shows the configuration file for two routers using CHAP authentication between them.  The password set on each router, the fact that the usernames are configured to be the hostname of the connecting router, and the fact that the password is the same password on each router is highlighted.  The figure also highlights the command p.p.p. authentication CHAP. Figure four is an interactive activity that allows the learner to configure CHAP authentication on a serial interface on a router.
