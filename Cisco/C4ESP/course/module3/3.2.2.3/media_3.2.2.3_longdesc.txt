Figure one shows the P.P.P. layered architecture at the Network layer.  The figure highlights the Network layer and is showing support for both I.P. version 4 and I.P. version 6.  P.P.P. uses N.C.Pâ€™s to negotiate the Layer 3 protocols that will be used to carry data packets. They provide functional fields containing standardized codes to indicate the network layer protocol type that P.P.P. encapsulates. Figure two is a table listing P.P.P. protocol field numbers.  The table includes the hexadecimal value of 8 0 2 1 for the I.P. version 4 protocol and 8 0 5 7 is for the I.P. version 6 protocol.  The value C 0 2 3 is for the password authentication protocol and C 2 2 3 is for the challenge handshake authentication protocol.
