Figure one shows the standard c.c.n.a. lab topology with i.p.v. 4 and i.p.v. 6 addressing displayed.  P.C. one is using Router one as its default gateway and router one is using router two as its gateway of last resort. Figure two shows the output from the show i.p. route on router one and the route print command on p.c. one. Figure three shows the output from the show i.p.v. 6 route command on router one and the i.p. config command on p.c. one. Figure four shows the output from the show i.p.v. 6 interface gigabit ethernet zero slash zero command on router one.  The joined group addresses are highlighted. Figure five shows the the i.p.v. 6 unicast dash routing command on router one followed by the output from the show i.p.v. 6 interface gigabit ethernet zero slash zero command on router one. Figure six shows the output from the i.p. config command on p.c. one.
