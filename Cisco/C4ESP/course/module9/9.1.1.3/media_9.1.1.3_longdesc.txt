Figure shows a cloud. The cloud represents the baseline of a network.  Establishing a baseline helps answer these questions: How does the network perform during a normal or average day? Where are the most errors occurring? What alert thresholds should be set for the devices that need to be monitored? Can the network meet the identified policies? What part of the network is most heavily used? What part of the network is least used?
