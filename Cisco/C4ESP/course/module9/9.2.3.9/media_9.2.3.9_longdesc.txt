Figure one shows the standard c.c.n.a. lab topology with i.p.v. 4 and i.p.v. 6 addressing displayed.  The call-out from router three states that to prevent spoofing attacks, deny all packets with a source address of one seventy two dot sixteen dot one dot zero slash twenty four from entering serial zero slash zero slash zero. Figure two shows the output from the show i.p. access dash lists command on router three, followed by the output from the show i.p. interface serial zero slash zero slash one pipe include access list command, followed by the output from the show i.p. interface gigabit ethernet zero slash zero slash one pipe include access list command. Figure three shows the commands for removing the access list one hundred from inbound on gigabit ethernet zero slash zero and adding it to inbound on serial zero slash zero slash one.
