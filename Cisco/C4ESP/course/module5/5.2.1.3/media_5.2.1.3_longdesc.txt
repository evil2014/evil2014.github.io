Figure one shows the output from the "show i. p. nat translations" command with no active sessions.  The outside addresses are blank.  Also shown is the output from the "show i. p. nat translations" command with an active session.  The outside addresses are present.  This demonstrates that nat translations are always present with static nat. Figure two shows the output from the "clear i. p. nat statistics" command followed by the "show i. p. nat statistics" command showing no hits.  When a p. c. establishes a session with the web server, the output from the "show i. p. nat statistics" command is shown with five hits.
