The modem at the subscriber end is labeled D.C.E. and is connected to a D.T.E. at the same location.  On the provider end, the local loop connects to a C.O. Switch.  The boundary between the subscriber and provider separate the two regions into Enterprise Edge (Subscriber) and Service Provider Edge (Provider).
