Figure one is an interactive activity that allows the learner to identifying several encryption terms as symmetric or asymmetric. Figure two is an interactive activity that allows the learner to place the steps involved in the data integrity and authentication process in the correct order. Figure three is an interactive activity that allows the learner to match integrity and authentication terms with their corresponding descriptions. Figure four is an interactive activity that allows the learner to identifying i.p. sec options as secure or insecure.
