Figure one shows two routers connected over the Internet with a G.R.E. tunnel.  The routers are using serial zero slash zero slash zero interfaces. Figure two shows two routers connected over the Internet with a G.R.E. tunnel.  The routers are using serial zero slash zero slash zero interfaces.  Router one tunnel zero interface is one ninety two dot one sixty eight dot two dot one, and router two tunnel zero interface is one ninety two dot one sixty eight dot two dot two.  Each router's physical interface is on a different network, which is different from the tunnel network.  The configuration commands are listed for router one below the image. Figure three shows the same information as figure two, except the configuration commands for router two are listed below the image. Figure four is a table listing some of the G.R.E. commands and their descriptions.
