Figure one has two diagrams. The first diagram is labeled Authentication. It shows router one connected to router two, and the data is in plain text.  The second diagram is labeled Encapsulating Security Payload. It shows router one connected to router two, but the data is encrypted.  Both examples support authentication and integrity. Figure two shows the choices available for each component of the i.p. sec framework. Figure three shows the components for the i.p. sec framework filled in for A.H. and E.S.P.
