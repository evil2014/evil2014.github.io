Figure one shows the demarcation point where the phone line enters the customer's premise.  On one side of this point is the customerâ€™s site. On the other side, are the phone lines that travel to the central office site where the POTs splitter separates the voice and data carried on the phone line. Figure two shows a micro filer that is used to separate voice and data on a line so a particular phone jack can be used for voice communications. Figure three shows a POTs splitter, which separates the D.S.L. traffic from the POTs traffic.
