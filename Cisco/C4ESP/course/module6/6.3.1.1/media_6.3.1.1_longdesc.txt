Figure one shows a legacy dial up connection from a computer to an I.S.P.  The connection uses a telephone line and the encapsulation of an I.P. with a P.P.P. header is shown. Figure two shows a computer connecting to an I.S.P. through a D.S.L. modem.  The I.P. packet is encapsulated with a P.P.P. header, which is then encapsulated with an Ethernet header, which is processed by the D.S.L. modem.
