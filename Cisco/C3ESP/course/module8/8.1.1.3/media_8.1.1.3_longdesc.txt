Figure one shows the output from the "show i. p. protocols" command on router one.  Automatic summarization disabled is highlighted. Figure two shows the output from the "show i. p. route e. i. g. r. p." command.  The three subnets are listed since automatic summarization is disabled. Figure three shows the result of the "router e. i. g. r. p. one" followed by "auto dash summary" commands on router one and router two.  Figure four is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice displaying the e. i. g. r. p. routing table and enabling auto summarization.
