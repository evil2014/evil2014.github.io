Figure one shows the standard lab topology.  The link between router one and two shows as sixty four k. b. p. s., the link between router one and router three shows as one thousand five hundred and forty four k. b. p. s., and the link between router two and three shows as one thousand twenty four k. b. p. s. Figure two shows the output from the "show i. p. v. 6. route e. i. g. r. p." command on router three.
