Figure one shows the standard lab topology.  The link between router one and two shows as sixty four k. b. p. s., the link between router one and router three shows as one thousand five hundred and forty four k. b. p. s, and the link between router two and three shows as one thousand twenty four k. b. p. s. Figure two shows the syntax for configuring the maximum bandwidth that e. i. g. r. p. will use on an interface of router one and two. Figure three is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice configuring the maximum bandwidth e. i. g. r. p. will use on an interface. Figure two shows the syntax for configuring the maximum bandwidth that e. i. g. r. p. will use on an interface of router one and two using i. p. v. 6.
