Figure one shows two routers connected with a serial cable.  Router one has two lans and router three has one lan. Figure two shows the output from the "ping" command on router three attempting to reach the ten network attached to router one.  This ping is unsuccessful. Figure three shows the output from the "show i. p. protocols" on router one. The output indicates that router one is not including the ten network in its e. i. g. r. p. updates. Figure four shows the syntax for adding the ten network to the e. i. g. r. p. configuration on router one. Figure five sows the output from the "show i. p. route" command on router one along with a successful ping to the ten network.
