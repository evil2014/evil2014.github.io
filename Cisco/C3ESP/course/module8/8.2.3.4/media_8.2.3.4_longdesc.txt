Figure one shows the standard lab topology to be used for the next three activities. Figure two is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice troubleshooting e. i. g. r. p. based on the output from the "show i. p. route" command. Figure three is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice troubleshooting e. i. g. r. p. based on the output from the "show i. p. route" command. Figure four is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice troubleshooting e. i. g. r. p. based on the output from the "show i. p. route" command.
