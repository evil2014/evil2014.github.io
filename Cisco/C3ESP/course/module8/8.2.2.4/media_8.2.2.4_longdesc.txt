Figure one shows the standard lab topology.  This topology will be used to answer questions for the next three scenarios. Figure two is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice troubleshooting based on the output from the "show i. p. interface brief" command. Figure three is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice troubleshooting based on the output from the "show i. p. protocols" command. Figure four is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice troubleshooting based on the output from the "show i. p. e. i. g. r. p. neighbors" command.
