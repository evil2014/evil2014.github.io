Figure shows a network where router one is connected to i. s. p. and router two.  Router two summarized the one seventy two dot sixteen dot zero dot zero and sent it to router one.  Router two also has a default static route pointing to router one.  As a result of the summary route, router one sends packets destined for one seventy two dot sixteen dot four dot ten to router two.  As a result of its default static route, router two forwards these packets back to router one.  This is a routing loop.
