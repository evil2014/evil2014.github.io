Figure one shows the standard lab diagram without the extra link between router one and router three.  Both router one and three have a lan in the ten network and both have automatic summarization on for e. i. g. r. p. Therefore, both are advertising the ten network at the classful boundary. Figure two shows the syntax for configuring e. i. g. r. p. on routers one and three including auto summary. Figure three shows the output from the "show i. p. route" command on router two.  This shows that router two has two paths to the ten network. Figure four shows the output from the "show i. p. protocols" command on routers one and three.  The ten network is highlighted to show it is being summarized. Figure five shows the output from the "show i. p. route" command on router two after automatic summarization has been disabled on routers one and three.  The individual ten networks are now listed rather than the summary.
