Figure one shows the standard lab diagram with the extra link between router one and router three.  Router two is connected to i. s. p., and the internal network is highlighted excluding the link between router two and i. s. p.  Each router has a lock on the serial interfaces. Figure two shows the output from the "show i. p. e. i. g. r. p. neighbors" command on all three routers.
