Figure one shows a router with three serial cables and one lan.  The lan interface is circled.  The output from the "show i. p. protocols" command is listed below and the passive interfaces are highlighted.  The lan interface is the only passive interface. Figure two shows the standard lab diagram with the extra link between router one and router three.  Router two is connected to i. s. p. Figure three shows the output for configuring the link between router two and i. s. p. as a passive interface. Figure four shows the output from the "show i. p. route" command on router one.
