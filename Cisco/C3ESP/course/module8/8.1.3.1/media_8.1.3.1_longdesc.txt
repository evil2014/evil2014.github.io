Figure one shows the standard lab diagram with the extra link between router one and router three.  Router two is connected to i. s. p. and the internal network is highlighted excluding the link between router two and i. s. p..  Figure two shows router two having a default static route pointing to i. s. p. and propagating it to routers one and three. Figure three shows the syntax for configuring a default static route on router two and propagating it through the e. i. g. r. p. routing process. Figure four shows the output from the "show i. p. route" command on router two demonstrating the default static route is present. Figure five shows the output from the "show i. p. protocols" command on router two demonstrating that e. i. g. r. p. is redistributing static.
