Figure one shows the standard lab diagram with the extra link between router one and router three.  Router two is connected to i. s. p., and the internal network is highlighted excluding the link between router two and i. s. p.  All routers are using i. p. v. 6.Figure two shows the syntax for configuring loopback interfaces with i. p. v. 6 addresses. Figure three shows the syntax for configuring a summary address for e. i. g. r. p. using i. p. v. 6.Figure four shows the output of the "show i. p. v. 6. route" command on router one.
