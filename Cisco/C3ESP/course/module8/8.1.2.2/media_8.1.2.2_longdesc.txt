Figure one shows the standard lab diagram with the extra link between router one and router three.  Router two is connected to i. s. p., and the internal network is highlighted excluding the link between router two and i. s. p.  Router three is advertising a summary e. i. g. r. p. route to router one and router two.  This summary route includes the loopback interfaces on router three. Figure two shows how to calculate a summary route by converting the i. p. address to binary and finding all the matching bits.  The syntax for configuring a summary e. i. g. r. p. route is listed below. Figure three is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice configuring a summary route.
