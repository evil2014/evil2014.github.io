Figure one is a topology with three routers. Each router is connected to the other two and each has a LAN.  This topology will be used to work with the next three scenarios. Figure two is an interactive activity allowing the learner to practice matching the exit interface with the destination networks on router three based on the topology in figure one. Figure three is an interactive activity allowing the learner to practice matching the exit interface with the destination networks on router one based on the topology in figure one. Figure four is an interactive activity allowing the learner to practice matching the exit interface with the destination networks on router two based on the topology in figure one.
