Figure one shows the standard lab diagram with the extra link between router one and router three.  Router two is connected to i. s. p., and the internal network is highlighted excluding the link between router two and i. s. p.  All routers are using i. p. v. 6. addressing. Figure two shows router two having a default static route using i. p. v. 6. pointing to i. s. p. and propagating it to routers one and three. Figure three shows the output of the "show i. p. route" command on routers one and three demonstrating that they have learned the default static route through e. i. g. r. p.
