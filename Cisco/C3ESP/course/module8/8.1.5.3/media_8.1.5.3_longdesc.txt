Figure one shows the standard lab diagram with the extra link between router one and router three.  Router two is connected to i. s. p., and the internal network is highlighted excluding the link between router two and i. s. p. Figure two shows the syntax for configuring a key chain for e. i. g. r. p. and assigning it to the appropriate interfaces on router one. Figure three shows the syntax for configuring a key chain for e. i. g. r. p. and assigning it to the appropriate interfaces on router two. Figure four is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice configuring e. i. g. r. p. with authentication on router three. Figure five shows the syntax for configuring a key chain for e. i. g. r. p. and assigning it to the appropriate interfaces on router one using i. p. v. 6.
