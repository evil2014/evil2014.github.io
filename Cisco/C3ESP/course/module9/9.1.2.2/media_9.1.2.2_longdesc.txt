Figure one shows a router and a server demonstrating that the i. o. s. can be backed up to a t. f. t. p. server. Figure two shows a successful result of the router pinging the server from the router.  It also shows the output from the "show flash colon zero" command on the router. Figure three shows the syntax for copying the i. o. s. from flash to the t. f. t. p. server. Figure four is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice backing up an i. o. s. file to a t. f. t. p. server.
