These figures are based on the standard lab diagram with an extra link between router one and router three. Figure one shows the lab diagram with a connection from router two to the Internet via i. s. p.  All serial links are labeled with bandwidth, network i. d., and prefix. Figure two shows the output of the "show running dash config" command on router one.  This lists the interfaces and their current i. p. configuration. Figure three shows the output of the "show running dash config" command on router two.  This lists the interfaces and their current i. p. configuration. Figure four shows the output of the "show running dash config" command on router three.  This lists the interfaces and their current i. p. configuration.
