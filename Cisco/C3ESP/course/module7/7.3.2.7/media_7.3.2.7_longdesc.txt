Figure one is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice matching the appropriate bandwidth value and delay value with its location in the metric formula to calculate the metric.  Values are listed on the diagram for the bandwidth of the links.  A table of delay values is also shown. Figure two is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice matching the appropriate bandwidth value and delay value with its location in the metric formula to calculate the metric.  Values are listed on the diagram for the bandwidth of the links.  A table of delay values is also shown. Figure three is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice matching the appropriate bandwidth value and delay value with its location in the metric formula to calculate the metric.  Values are listed on the diagram for the bandwidth of the links.  A table of delay values is also shown.
