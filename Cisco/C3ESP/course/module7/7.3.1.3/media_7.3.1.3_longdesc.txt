Figure shows two routers. Each router is running e. i. g. r. p. Router one is sending a hello packet to router two.  Router two is sending an update and hello packet to router one.  Router one sends back an acknowledgement packet and an update packet to router two.  Finally, router two sends an acknowledgement packet back to router one.  This completes the cycle and both routing tables are up to date.
