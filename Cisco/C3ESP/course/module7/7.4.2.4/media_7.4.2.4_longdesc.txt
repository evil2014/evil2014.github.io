Figure one shows the syntax for activating i. p. v. 6 e. i. g. r. p. on each interface on router one and two. Figure two is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice activating i. p. v. 6 e. i. g. r. p. on each interface on router three. Figure three shows the syntax for configuring a passive interface for e. i .g. r. p. using i. p. v. 6. The command is entered under the routing process and is the same as the i. p. v. 4 command.
