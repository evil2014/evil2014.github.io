Figure one shows the output of the "show i. p. e. i. g. r. p. topology" command on router one with the successor route highlighted in orange. Figure two shows the output of the "debug e. i. g. r. p. f. s. m." command on router one.  Then the serial interface is shut down and messages are displayed regarding the DUAL process. Figure three shows the output of the "show i. p. route" command on router one with the new successor listed. Figure four shows the output of the "show i. p. e. i. g. r. p. topology" command on router one with the new successor route listed and there is no feasible successor.
