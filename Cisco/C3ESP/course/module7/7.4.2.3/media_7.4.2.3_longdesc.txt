Figure one shows the syntax for configuring i. p. v. 6 routing for e. i. g. r. p. on router one. Figure two shows the syntax for configuring the e. i. g. r. p. router id on router one. Figure three shows the "no shut down" command after configuring the e. i. g. r. p. router id on router one.  This will bring up the i. p. v. 6 e. i. g. r. p. routing process, which is shut down by default. Figure four shows the process of configuring e.i.g.r.p. for i. p. v. 6, including the router id and the no shut down command on router two. Figure five is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice configuring e.i.g.r.p. for i. p. v. 6, including the router id and the no shut down command on router three.
