Figure one shows the standard lab diagram with the extra link between router one and router three.  Router two is connected to i. s. p., and the internal network is highlighted excluding the link between router two and i. s. p. Figure two shows the syntax for configuring bandwidth on the interfaces of router one, two, and three. Figure three shows the output of the "show interface" command on router one and two to display the bandwidth settings.  The default bandwidth for serial links is 1544 kilobits per second unless specified.
