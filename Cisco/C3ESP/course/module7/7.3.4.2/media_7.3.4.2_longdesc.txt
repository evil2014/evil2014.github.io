Figure one shows the standard lab diagram with the extra link between router one and router three.  Router two is connected to i. s. p., and the internal network is highlighted excluding the link between router two and i. s. p.  There is an arrow from router two pointing to the router three lan and router one is circled with "feasible successor" next to it.  The serial link between router two and router three is down. Figure two shows the output of the "show i. p. e. i. g. r. p. topology" command on router two with the successor and feasible successor routes highlighted in orange. Figure three shows the output of the "debug e. i. g. r. p. f. s. m." command on router two.  Then the serial interface is shut down and messages are displayed regarding the DUAL process. Figure four shows the output of the "show i. p. route" command on router two with the new successor listed. Figure five shows the output of the "show i. p. e. i. g. r. p. topology" command on router two with the new successor route listed.
