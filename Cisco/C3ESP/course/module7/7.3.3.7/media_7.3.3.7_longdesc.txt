Figure one shows the standard lab diagram with the extra link between router one and router three.  Router two is connected to i. s. p., and the internal network is highlighted excluding the link between router two and i. s. p. Figure two shows the output of the "show  i. p. route" command on router one.  The feasible distance and next hop router address are highlighted in orange. Figure three shows the output of the "show i. p. e. i. g. r. p. topology" command on router one.  The successor address, distances, and exit interface are highlighted in orange. Figure four shows the output of the "show i. p. e. i. g. r. p. topology" command on router one.  The successor and potential feasible successors address, distances, and exit interface are highlighted in orange.  The later address is not a feasible successor due to the feasibility condition not being met.
