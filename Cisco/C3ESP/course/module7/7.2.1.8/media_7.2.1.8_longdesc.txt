Figure one shows the standard lab diagram with the extra link between router one and router three.  Router two is connected to i. s. p., and the internal network is highlighted excluding the link between router two and i. s. p. Each router is sending a hello packet out its lan interface. Figure two shows the syntax for configuring a passive interface on router one and router three. This prevents routing updates from being sent out the lan interface. Figure three shows the output of the "show i. p. protocols" command on router three. The passive interfaces are highlighted. Figure four is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice configuring e. i. g. r. p. with passive interface command.
