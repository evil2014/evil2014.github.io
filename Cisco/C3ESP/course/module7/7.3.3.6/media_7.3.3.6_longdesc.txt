Figure one shows the output of the "show i. p. e. i. g. r. p. topology" command on router two.  The Status, destination network, number of successors, and feasible distance are highlighted in orange. Figure two shows the output of the "show i. p. e. i. g. r. p. topology" command on router two.  The next hop address, feasible distance, reported distance, and outbound interface of the successor route is highlighted in orange. Figure three shows the output of the "show i. p. e. i. g. r. p. topology" command on router two.  The next hop address, feasible distance, reported distance, and outbound interface of the potential feasible successor route is highlighted in orange.
