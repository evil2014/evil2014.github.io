Figure one shows three routers connected to each other with a serial link.  Each router has a lan.  The addressing and bandwidth are listed on the diagram.  This is an e. i. g. r. p. domain. Figure two is an interface activity that allows the learner to practice determining which route will be a successor and which will be a feasible successor from router two.  The output of the "show i. p. e. i. g. r. p. topology" command is listed above. Figure three is an interface activity that allows the learner to practice determining which route will be a successor and which will be a feasible successor from router two.  The output of the "show i. p. e. i. g. r. p. topology" command is listed above.
