Figure one shows the standard lab diagram with the extra link between router one and router three.  Router two is connected to i. s. p., and the internal network is highlighted excluding the link between router two and i. s. p..  I. p. v. 6 lan addresses are used. Figure two shows the syntax for configuring an i. p. v. 6 link local address on the interfaces on router one. Figure three shows the syntax for configuring an i. p. v. 6 link local address on the interfaces on router two. Figure four is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice configuring the interfaces on router three with link local addresses. Figure five shows the output of the "show i. p. v. 6 interface brief" command on router one, highlighting the link local addresses for each interface.
