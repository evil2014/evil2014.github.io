Figure one shows the standard lab diagram with the extra link between router one and router three.  Router two is connected to i. s. p., and the internal network is highlighted excluding the link between router two and i. s. p.  There is an arrow from router two pointing to the router three lan, and router one is circled with "feasible successor" next to it. Figure two shows the three routers connected with serial links.  Router one is sending router two and three its feasible distance to the router three lan.  The output of the "show i. p. route" command on router one is listed below with the metric or feasible distance highlighted in orange. Figure three shows the output of the "show i. p. route" command on router one and two.  The feasible distance is highlighted.  The caption asks the question, "Does it meet the feasibility condition?" Figure four shows the three routers connected with serial links.  Router two is sending router one the feasible distance to the router three lan. Router one is the new successor.
