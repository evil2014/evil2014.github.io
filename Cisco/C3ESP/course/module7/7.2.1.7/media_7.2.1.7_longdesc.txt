Figure one shows the standard lab diagram with the extra link between router one and router three.  Router two is connected to i. s. p., and the internal network is highlighted excluding the link between router two and i. s. p.  The serial interface on router two pointing to router three is circled including the i. p. address of dot nine. Figure two shows the syntax for configuring e. i. g. r. p. network statements for the circled serial interface on router two using the wildcard mask. Figure three shows the output of the "show running dash config" command on router two.  The e. i. g. r. p. section highlights the network just configured. Figure four is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice configuring e. i. g. r. p. on router three.
