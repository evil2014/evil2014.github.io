Figure one shows the standard lab diagram with the extra link between router one and router three.  Router two is connected to i. s. p., and the internal network is highlighted excluding the link between router two and i. s. p. Figure two shows the syntax for configuring the network statements under e. i. g. r. p. for router one. Figure three shows the syntax for configuring the network statements under e. i. g. r. p. for router two.  Immediately following this is a dual notification indicating a neighbor adjacency.
