This animation shows three routers. Each router is connected to each of the other two routers with a serial link.  When you click play, the router two lan goes down and router two sends an update packet to routers one and three.  Once routers one and three receive the update packet, and they send back an acknowledgement packet.  Router two then sends a query packet to routers one and three, which send a reply packet back to router two.  Router two then sends an acknowledgement packet back to routers one and three.
