Figure one shows a summarized type three L.S.A. message originating from an A.S.B.R. router being propagated through the backbone to the other A.B.R.s. Figure two shows a network link failure in one area resulting in an update L.S.A. being sent to the local A.B.R. However, the update L.S.A. is not being propagated to any other areas. This is because the update was suppressed through summarization.
