Figure one shows a multi area O.S.P.F. topology. In this topology, one A.B.R. is sending a summary route to a backbone router. Figure two shows a routing table before multi area O.S.P.F. route summarization takes place on one A.B.R (R1). The table includes two inter area entries. Figure three shows a routing table before multi area O.S.P.F. route summarization takes place on one A.B.R (R2). The table includes two inter area entries.
