Figure one shows a LAN with three areas; Area 1, Area 0, and Area 51. The routers contained within each of these areas are highlighted as Internal routers. Figure two shows that all routers contained within Area 0, and those connecting to other Areas, are known as backbone routers. Figure three shows that the routers that connect to other areas are known as area border routers (A.B.R.s).Figure four shows that the router connected between areas and connected to the internet is known as an autonomous system boundary router (A.S.B.R).
