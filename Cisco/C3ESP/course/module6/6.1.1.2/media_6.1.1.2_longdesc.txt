Figure one shows ten routers, which have been divided into three smaller areas. The routers are operating with a higher degree of efficiency due to the smaller routing tables, fewer number of LSAs, and diminished SPF algorithm processes. Figure two shows ten routers, which have been divided into three smaller areas; Area 1, Area 0, and Area 51. Area 51 is showing that LSA exchange only takes place among the routers in its own area and does not cross into the connected Area 0.
