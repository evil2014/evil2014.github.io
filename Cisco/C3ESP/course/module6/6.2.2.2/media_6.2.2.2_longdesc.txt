Figure one shows a multi area O.S.P.F. topology. In this topology, summarized routes are being forwarded from two A.B.R.s to a backbone A.S.B.R. The backbone A.S.B.R. is also connected to an external E.I.G.R.P. network. Figure two shows a multi area O.S.P.F. topology. In this topology, summarized routes are being forwarded from a backbone A.S.B.R. to the A.B.R.s that contain summarized routes from the external E.I.G.R.P. network.
