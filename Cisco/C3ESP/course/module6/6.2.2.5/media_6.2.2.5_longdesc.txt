Figure one shows two networks written in binary format. The first twenty-two bits of each network match. Figure two shows how to configure an area in multi area O.S.P.F. with a calculated summary address. Figure three shows an I.P. v 4. routing table with a multi area O.S.P.F. summary address highlighted. However, there is a Null zero exit interface. The Null zero interface is used by O.S.P.F. to help prevent routing loops when manual summarization is configured. Figure four shows an I.P. v4. routing table after it has been updated with an inter area summary route. Figure five shows the commands necessary to configure a router with a summary route in multi area O.S.P.F.
