Figure shows two topologies. Each topology has two switches. There are connections between the switches on two ports.  In the first topology, the connected ports on each switch are running at one gigabit per second, are in full duplex mode, and are placed in V LAN ten.  This configuration allows the formation of an ether channel.  In the second topology, the ports on each switch are running at one gigabit per second and are placed in V LAN ten. However, one port is running in half duplex mode while the port on the other switch is running in full duplex.  This configuration will not allow the formation of an ether channel.
