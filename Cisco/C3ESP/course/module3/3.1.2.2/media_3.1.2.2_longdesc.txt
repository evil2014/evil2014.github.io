Figure lists the three port modes for port aggregation protocol.  The first state is on, in which the channel member is active but without negotiation therefore no protocol.  The second state is desirable, in which the port is actively asking if the other side can or will participate.  The third state is auto, in which the port is passively waiting for the other side.  The figure shows the states of port aggregation protocol between two switches and when a channel establishment will occur.  This table is a summary of the page text.
