Figure one shows the output from the command, show ether channel summary.  This command is used in troubleshooting. In the figure, there is a letter D listed after the ports involved in the ether channel to indicate that the ether channel is down. Figure two shows the output from the command, show run pipe begin interface port hyphen channel.  This command lists more detailed information regarding the ether channel, such as the switch ports that are configured in the ether channel and the mode they are in.  The figure is highlighting the fact that the ports on switch 1 are configured in the port aggregation protocol on mode, and the ports on switch two are configured in the port aggregation protocol desirable mode.  This mismatch will not allow the formation of an ether channel. Figure three shows the reconfiguration of the ports on switch 1 from the on mode to the desirable mode, which allows the Ether Channel to become active.
