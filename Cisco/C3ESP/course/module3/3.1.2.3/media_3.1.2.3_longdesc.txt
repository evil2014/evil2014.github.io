Figure lists the three port modes for the link aggregation control protocol.  The first mode is on, in which the port is a Channel member without negotiation, therefore no protocol.  The second mode is active, in which the port is actively asking if the other side can or will participate.  The third mode is passive, in which the port is passively waiting for the other side.  The figure shows the states of link aggregation control protocol between two switches and when a channel establishment will occur.  This table is a summary of the page text.
