Figure one shows the commands required to configure an ether channel.  The commands begin in global configuration mode. The first command is, interface range fast Ethernet zero slash one hyphen two.  This command allows the remaining commands entered to be applied to ports 1 and 2.  The next command is, channel hyphen group 1 mode active, and creates the port channel interface.  The next command is, interface port hyphen channel 1, and moves to the configuration mode for the port channel. The command, switchport mode trunk, configures the interface as a trunk interface.  The last command is, switchport trunk allowed v lan 1 comma 2 comma 20, and it configures allowed V LANs on the link.  Figure two is an interactive activity that allows the learner to configure an ether channel on two ports of a switch.
