Figure one shows several routers connected to each other.  Some are connected with wan links and some with lan links.   They are all part of o.s.p.f. area zero. Figure two shows several routers connected to each other.  Some are connected with wan links and some with lan links. The routers on the left are connected to a lan and are in o.s.p.f. area one, the two in the middle are in o.s.p.f. area zero, and the routers on the right are connected with wan links and are in o.s.p.f. area fifty one. Figure three shows how e.i.g.r.p. uses protocol independent modules.  There are three tables for i.p.v.4. and three for i.p.v.6..
