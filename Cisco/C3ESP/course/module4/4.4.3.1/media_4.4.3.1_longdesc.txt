Figure one shows a flow chart of the bottom up approach to troubleshooting network problems. The chart indicates that you should start at the physical layer and work up. Figure two shows a flow chart of the top down approach to troubleshooting network problems. The chart indicates that you should start at the application layer and work down. Figure three shows a flow chart of the divide and conquer approach to troubleshooting network problems. The chart indicates that you should start somewhere in the middle and work in either direction.
