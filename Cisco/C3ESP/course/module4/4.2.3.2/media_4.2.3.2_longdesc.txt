Figure one shows the radio spectrum of the electromagnetic spectrum.  The wireless standards are organized into groups based on frequency. Figure two is a graph showing how the channels overlap for eight zero two dot eleven b. wireless. Figure three is a graph showing the non-overlapping channels for eight zero two dot eleven b wireless.  They are channel one, six, and eleven. Figure four is a graph showing the non-overlapping channels for eight zero two dot eleven g. and n. wireless using twenty megahertz channel width. Figure four is a graph showing the non-overlapping channels for eight zero two dot eleven n. wireless using forty megahertz channel width.
