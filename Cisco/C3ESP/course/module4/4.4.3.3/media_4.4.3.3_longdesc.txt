Figure one shows a wireless access point with five devices connected. Three devices are using the 5 gigahertz band and two are using the 2.4 gigahertz band. Figure two shows the settings to use different names for the two bands so it is easier to connect to the appropriate s.s.i.d. based on usage requirements.
