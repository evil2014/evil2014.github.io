Figure one is an interactive activity that allows the learner to match the speed, frequency, and backwards compatibility with their corresponding w. lan standards. Figure two is an interactive activity that allows the learner to match microwave frequencies with their corresponding w. lan standards. Figure three is an interactive activity that allows the learner to match microwave frequency applications with their frequencies.
