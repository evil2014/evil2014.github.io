Figure one is an interactive activity that allows the learner to identify the steps to solving a slow network problem. Figure two is an interactive activity that allows the learner to identify the steps to solving a connectivity problem. Figure three is an interactive activity that allows the learner to identify the steps to solving a slow network with intermittent connectivity problems.
