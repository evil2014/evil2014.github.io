Figure one shows the bridge i.d. fields in two formats.  One with extended system i.d. and one without.  Without, the priority takes 2 bytes.  With, the priority uses 4 bits and the system i.d. uses the other 12 bits. Figure two shows three switches, each connected to the other two with a trunk link.  Each switch has a caption that displays the root bridge i.d., its bridge i.d., and the path cost.  The priorities are highlighted and switch one is identified as the root bridge because it has the lowest priority. Figure three shows three switches, each connected to the other two with a trunk link.  Each switch has a caption that displays the root bridge i.d., its bridge i.d., and the path cost.  This time the priorities are all the same.  The mac addresses are highlighted and switch two is identified as the root bridge because it has the lowest mac address.
