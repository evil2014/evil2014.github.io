Figure one shows a table with four different ethernet link speeds and their associated spanning tree costs. Figure two shows the commands to configure a specific link cost, rather than allowing spanning tree to automatically set it.  It also shows the command to reset from manual assignment back to automatic assignment. Figure three shows the two paths from switch two to switch one (the root bridge) and their costs.  This is necessary to figure out which port on switch two will become the root port. Figure four shows the output from the show spanning dash tree command on switch two.  The cost to the root bridge and the local bridge i.d. are both highlighted.
