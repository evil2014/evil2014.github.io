Figure one shows four switches that are inter-connected.  Each port is labeled with its mode, and switch two is labeled as the root bridge.  The priorities and mac addresses are listed for each switch. Figure two shows four switches that are inter-connected.  Each port is labeled with its mode, and switch two is labeled as the root bridge.   Switch four has one port that has switched from blocking to forwarding erroneously. Figure three shows four switches that are inter-connected.  Each port is labeled with its mode, and switch two is labeled as the root bridge.  A packet enters the network at switch three and bounces around for ever now that a loop has been introduced into the topology.
