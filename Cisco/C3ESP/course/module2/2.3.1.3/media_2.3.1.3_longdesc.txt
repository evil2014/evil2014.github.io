Figure one shows three switches inter-connected with trunk links.  There are three P.C.'s connected to switch two.  The ports the P.C.'s are connected to are configured with port fast and b.p.d.u. guard since they are edge ports. Figure two shows the commands to configure an edge port to use portfast and b.p.d.u. guard. Figure three shows the output from the show running dash config interface f. 0 slash 11.Figure four is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice configuring portfast and b.p.d.u. guard on an interface.
