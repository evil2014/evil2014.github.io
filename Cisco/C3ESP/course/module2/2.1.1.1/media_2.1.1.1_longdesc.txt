Figure one is an animation that shows three switches, s.1, s.2, and s.3.  Each switch is connected to the other two with a trunk link.  S.2 has P.C.1, P.C.2, and P.C.3 connected.  S.1 has P.C.4 connected.  P.C.1 is communicating with P.C.4 over the trunk from S.2 to S.1.  The packet travels from P.C.1, to S.2, to S.1, to P.C.4, and back.  Then, the trunk between S.1 and S.2 goes down.  S.2 detects the outage and redirects subsequent packets to S.3.Figure two shows a table listing the following considerations to make when implementing LAN Redundancy: M.A.C. database instability, Broadcast Storms, and Multiple frame transmission.
