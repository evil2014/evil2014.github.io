Figure one shows three switches, each connected to the other two with a trunk link.  Each switch has a caption that displays the root bridge i.d., its bridge i.d., and the path cost.  Each bridge thinks it is the root bridge until they exchange b.p.d.u.'s and determine otherwise. Figure two shows switch 3 receiving a b.p.d.u. from switch 2 with a lower bridge i.d. so it changes its root bridge to switch 2's bridge i.d.. Figure three shows switch 1 receiving a b.p.d.u. from switch 2.  Switch one has a lower i.d. than switch 2 so it remains the root bridge. Figure four shows switch 3 sending b.p.d.u.'s to switches one and two. Figure five shows switch 2 receiving the b.p.d.u. from switch three.  Switch 2 has a lower i.d. so it remains the root. Figure six shows switch 1 receiving the b.p.d.u. from switch three.  Switch 1 has a lower i.d. so it remains the root. Figure seven shows switch 1 sending b.p.d.u.'s to switches 2 and 3.Figure eight shows switch 3 receiving the b.p.d.u. from switch 1 with a lower i.d. than its already changed root bridge, so it updates its root bridge i.d. to that of switch 1.Figure eight shows switch 2 receiving the b.p.d.u. from switch 1 with a lower i.d. than its already changed root bridge, so it updates its root bridge i.d. to that of switch 1.
