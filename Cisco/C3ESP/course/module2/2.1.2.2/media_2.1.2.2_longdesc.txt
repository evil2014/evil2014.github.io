Figure shows three switches, s.1, s.2, and s.3.  Each is connected to the other two with a trunk link.  S.2 has P.C.1, P.C.2, and P.C.3 connected.  S.1 has P.C.4 connected. The diagram shows the different port roles for spanning tree.  Some ports are root ports (forwarding), some are designated ports (forwarding), and some are alternate or non-designated ports (blocking).
