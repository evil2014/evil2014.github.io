Figure one shows three switches inter-connected with a forth switch connected to switch 1.  There are three P.C.'s connected to switch 2, and the ports they connect to on switch 2 are highlighted.  There is a router connected to switch 4 and the port it connects to is highlighted.  These highlighted ports are known as edge ports. Figure two shows three switches inter-connected with a forth switch connected to switch 1.  The ports on the links between the switches are highlighted.  These ports are non-edge ports.  These are typically trunk links, and b.p.d.u.'s travel on these links between the switches.
