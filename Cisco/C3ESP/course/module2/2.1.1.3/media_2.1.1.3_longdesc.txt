This animation shows three switches, s.1, s.2, and s.3.  Each is connected to the other two with a trunk link.  S.2 has P.C.1, P.C.2, and P.C.3 connected.  S.1 has P.C.4 connected.  The animation demonstrates how a broadcast storm can degrade network performance when a layer two loop exists.  The switches continue to forward the broadcasts and replicate them at the same time.
