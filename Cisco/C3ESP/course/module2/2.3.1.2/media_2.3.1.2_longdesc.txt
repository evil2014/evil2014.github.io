Figure one shows three switches inter-connected with trunk links.  Switch one has a call-out that shows the use of the spanning dash tree v. lan one root primary command.  This ensures that switch one will become the root bridge.  Switch three has a call-out that shows the use of the spanning dash tree v. lan one priority command.  This allows you to set the priority of the bridge for the root bridge elections.  Switch two has a call-out that shows the use of the spanning dash tree v. lan one root secondary command.  This will allow switch two to become the root bridge in the event of a failure of the current root bridge. Figure two shows the output from the show spanning dash tree command. Figure three is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice configuring the bridge priority.
