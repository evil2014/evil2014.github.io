Figure one is an animation that shows three switches, s.1, s.2, and s.3.  Each is connected to the other two with a trunk link.  S.2 has P.C.1, P.C.2, and P.C.3 connected.  S.1 has P.C.4 connected.  The animation demonstrates how S.T.P. prevents a broadcast storm, by placing a port on S.2 into blocking mode thus preventing a loop. Figure two is an animation that shows three switches, s.1, s.2, and s.3.  Each is connected to the other two with a trunk link.  S.2 has P.C.1, P.C.2, and P.C.3 connected.  S.1 has P.C.4 connected.  The animation demonstrates how S.T.P. recovers from an outage by changing the state of the blocked port to forwarding, thus restoring a redundant link and forwarding packets correctly.
