Figure one shows three switches inter-connected with trunk links.  Switch three is the primary root bridge for v. lan twenty and the secondary root bridge for v. lan ten.  Switch one is the primary root bridge for v. lan ten and secondary for v. lan twenty. Figure two shows the commands to configure the primary and secondary root bridges on switch one and three using the primary and secondary key words. Figure three shows the commands to configure switch one to be root for v. lan ten and three to be root for v. lan twenty using the priority of 4,096.Figure four shows the output from the show spanning dash tree active command on switch one. The output demonstrates that switch one is the root bridge for v. lan ten. Figure five shows the output from the show running dash config command on switch. The spanning tree commands are highlighted. Figure six is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice configuring switch three as primary root for v. lan twenty and secondary root for v. lan ten.
