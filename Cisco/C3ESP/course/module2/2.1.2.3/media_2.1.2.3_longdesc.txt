Figure one shows three switches, s.1, s.2, and s.3.  Each is connected to the other two with a trunk link.  S.2 has P.C.1, P.C.2, and P.C.3 connected.  S.1 has P.C.4 connected.  Each switch shows the bridge I.D., priority, and Mac address.  Switch 1 is noted as the root bridge due to the lowest priority value. Figure two shows the bridge I.D. fields.  These include priority, the extended system I.D., and the mac address.
