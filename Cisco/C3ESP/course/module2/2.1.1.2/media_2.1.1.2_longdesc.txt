This animation shows three switches, s.1, s.2, and s.3.  Each is connected to the other two with a trunk link.  S.2 has P.C.1, P.C.2, and P.C.3 connected.  S.1 has P.C.4 connected.  The animation demonstrates how mac address databases can become unstable when layer two loops exist in a network.  A broadcast can cause the incorrect mac address to port map to exist due to the loop as the broadcast continues to bounce around the network.
