Figure one shows the standard lab diagram with the extra link between router one and router three.  Router two is connected to i. s. p. The internal network is highlighted, excluding the link between router two and i. s. p. Figure two shows the output from the "show i. p. v. 6. route o. s. p. f." command on router one. Figure three shows the syntax for configuring a default static route using i. p. v. 6. to the service provider.  Below that, is the syntax for propagating that default static route through the o. s. p. f. routing process.
