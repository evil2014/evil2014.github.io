Figure one shows two routers connected with a serial link.  Router one is encrypting an o. s. p. f. update using a shared key. Figure two shows router one sending the encrypted message to router two. Figure three shows router two receiving the encrypted message and comparing the signatures.  If they match, then router two will accept the message. If they do not match, router two will discard the message.
