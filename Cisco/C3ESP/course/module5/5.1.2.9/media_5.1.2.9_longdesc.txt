Figure one shows three routers connected to a switch.  Router one, router two (the B. D. R.), and router three (the D. R.).Figure two shows the syntax for configuring the interface o. s. p. f. priority on router one to two hundred and fifty five. Figure three shows the syntax for configuring the interface o. s. p. f. priority on router three to zero. Figure four shows the syntax for clearing the o. s. p. f. process. Figure five shows the output from the "show i. p. o. s. p. f. interface gig zero slash zero" command on router one indicating that it is the D. R.  Below that, is the output from the "show i. p. o. s. p. f. neighbor" command. Figure six is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice using the "show i. p. o. s. p. f. interface" and "show i. p. o. s. p. f. neighbor" commands.
