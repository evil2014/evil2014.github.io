Figure one shows four routers connected to a switch.  There is a bi-directional arrow between router one and each of the other routers.  Router one is designated as the D. R. in this topology. Figure two is an animation that shows five routers connected to a switch.  Router two is labeled the D. R. and router three is labeled the B. D. R.  Router one sends an l. s. a. to the d. r. and the b. d. r.  The D. R. then forwards the l. s. a. to the other routers including the b. d. r.
