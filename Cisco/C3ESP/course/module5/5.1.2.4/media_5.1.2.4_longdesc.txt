Figure one shows three routers connected to a switch.  Router two is the D. R. and router three is the B. D. R. Figure two shows the output from the "show i. p. o. s. p. f. interface gigabit ethernet zero slash zero" command on router one.  Router one is a drother. Figure three shows the output from the "show i. p. o. s. p. f. interface gigabit ethernet zero slash zero" command on router two.  Router two is the b. d. r. Figure four shows the output from the "show i. p. o. s. p. f. interface gigabit ethernet zero slash zero" command on router three.  Router three is the d. r.
