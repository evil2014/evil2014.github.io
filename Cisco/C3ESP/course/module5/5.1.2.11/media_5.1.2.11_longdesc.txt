Figure one is a topology with 6 routers.   Five of them are connected to a switched network and two have serial links.  This topology will be used for the next two scenarios. Figure two is an interactive activity allowing the learner to match the router I. D. with the appropriate router. Figure three is an interactive activity allowing the learner to match the hostname with the i. p. address.
