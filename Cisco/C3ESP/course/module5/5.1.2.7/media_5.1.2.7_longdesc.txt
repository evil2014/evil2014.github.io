Figure one shows three routers connected to a switch. Router one is the B. D. R.  Router two is the D. R. Router three has an x on it. Figure two shows three routers connected to a switch. Router one is the B. D. R.  Router two is the D. R. Router three comes back on line as a drother. Figure three shows three routers connected to a switch. Router one is the B. D. R.  Router two is the D. R. Router three is a drother.  A fourth router is added and becomes a drother. Figure four shows three routers connected to a switch. Router one is the B. D. R.  Router two is the D. R. Routers three and four are drothers.  Router two (the D. R.) goes down, router one becomes the new D. R., and router four becomes the new B. D. R.
