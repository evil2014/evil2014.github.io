Figure one shows the standard lab diagram with the extra link between router one and router three.  Router two is connected to i. s. p. The internal network is highlighted, excluding the link between router two and i. s. p. Figure two shows the output from the "show i. p. route" command on router one. Figure three shows the output from the "show i. p. interface brief" command on router one and a successful ping. Figure four shows the output from the "show i. p. o. s. p. f. interface serial zero slash zero slash zero" command. Figure five shows the output from the "show i. p. protocols" ccommand on router one. The serial zero slash zero slash zero is highlighted to identify it as a passive interface. Figure six shows the syntax for configuring serial zero slash zero slash zero so it is not passive. Figure seven shows the output from the "show i.  p. route o. s. p. f." command on router one.
