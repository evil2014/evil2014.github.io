Figure one shows four routers connected to a switch. Figure two shows four routers connected to a switch with arrows between each switch and every other switch. Figure three shows a table matching a few numbers of routers with the corresponding number of adjacencies formed.  As the number of routers grows the number of adjacencies grows exponentially.
