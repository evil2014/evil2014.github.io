Figure one shows the standard lab diagram with the extra link between router one and router three.  Router two is connected to i. s. p. The internal network is highlighted, excluding the link between router two and i. s. p. Figure two shows the syntax for configuring the hello and dead interval timers on the serial zero slash zero slash zero interface on router one for i. p. v. 6..Figure three shows the output from the "show i. p. v. 6.  o. s. p. f. neighbor" command. Figure four shows the syntax for configuring the hello timer on the serial zero slash zero slash zero interface on router two. Figure five shows the output from the "show i. p. v. 6.  o. s. p. f. interface s. zero slash zero slash zero pipe include timer" command and the "show i. p. v. 6.  o. s. p. f. neighbor" command on router two.
